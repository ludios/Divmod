<b>What is Divunal like, as a game?</b>
<blockquote>
It's hard to explain quickly... The plot is complex, and has been added to and changed by a number of people, and figuring it all out is a major part of playing the game.
<p>
In short, Divunal is a text-based multiplayer roleplaying game. It is a roleplaying game, in the sense that you act out the part of your character while playing the game, but it is played out on a computer, in text, rather than on someone's living room table. Unlike many other online games, playing your character is a major part of Divunal. It's not just about combat, or reaction time, or even about exploring a world and solving puzzles... Our intention was to create a complete world, albeit one you experience through text. The plot and world was meant to be part of the character's life, rather than a backdrop for the mechanisms of a simple video game.
<p>
Unlike some other MUDs, MOOs, and online games, we try very hard to keep the game In Character at all times. This can be sort of awkward for development, but that's why we encourage the use of IRC, AOLIM, and other chat systems for asking questions and chatting. That's what chat systems are for. :-)  We really don't want our fancy new game engine and imaginative world to become an overglorified chat room like so many other MOOs out there.
<p>
By the same token, we try very hard to make sure that everything in the game belongs there. It should be interactive, remain consistant with our design, and not be described with lots of slang terms and real world references; imposing "real life" on the game really doesn't help maintain the feel of the world. And finally, while just about any unusal sort of place or thing can be introduced to the game, it should usually be in the context of the Library. Divunal, the home of the players' characters, is a very specifically designed place, but the Library is a constantly expanding, geometrically impossible thing that connects many different worlds together, and you should keep your extremely creative work inside it.  :-)<BR>

<b>So... What happens when all of these features and plot elements come together?</b>
<blockquote>
Well... Explaining the ground rules of the game itself isn't that bad... But as for the plot and the World itself, well... it's tricky. The timeline and encyclopedia, while good sources of reference, don't present it very well. So to summarize, I've jotted down how the game would look from the viewpoint of the average character.
<p>
As a player, you begin the game by waking up an amnesiac in the ruins of a huge, unfamiliar city. You don't get to select a character class, pick your stats, or buy equipment... You're just given a few random characters of your preferred gender to choose from. This might seem overly simple, or facist, or something, given the way other games usually handle this, but bear with us.
<p>
In wandering around, you'll probably meet other people... Much like you, they've lost their memories. Some of them are dressed differently than others, and some of them are, now that you look, dressed like you... Things still aren't making much sense.
<p>
Further exploration of the city raises more questions... Some things seem familar to you, although you don't know why. Some people seem familiar to you, but you can't place them. People here have all sorts of different colors of hair, and they tend to dress in similar shades. This city is called Uth, and despite being ruined, it seems very peaceful... You can't think of who would do such a thing, or why anyone would want to... The idea of violence seems strange, and terrible. While most of the buildings are shattered, something in the center of the city stands intact, and higher than the rest... It's a temple.
<p>
The temple is full of the statues of your gods... But your gods are people... Metaphors for the society that was here before the fall.
<p>
The fall? You're not sure what the fall was, but things are starting to seem very familiar to you.
<p>
There's a bookstore here. It's perfectly intact along a street that has been laid to waste and burned to the ground... It's much bigger on the inside than you'd expect it to be. It's actually huge... like there are entire libraries inside it. There are... And the gods are here. Or people who look like them...
<p>
A woman named Tsiale was here when the fall... when it happened. She said the bookstore protected her, and now it's getting stronger somehow, because she believed in it. She says she summoned the gods here to Divunal to help everyone... Divunal. That's what this world is called.
<p>
Uth was a peaceful place once... The statue at the top of the temple is a statue of a very plain, unremarkable person, a commoner, looking out over the ruins, and there's a poem, that ends with "Look upon this city that peace has built." And there is a lot of writing underneath that you can't understand. Why can't you read it? What does it mean?
<p>
The gods are much more like people than they are like gods, but they do seem to have powers... But they're always busy, and seem to be preoccupied with something. They're very cryptic about this whole thing... Is there something they aren't telling us? What would upset a god, anyway?
<p> 
Someone climbed into one of the cracks in the ground, and found a city below this one... It's ruined too, but it's much, much older... It doesn't seem like it was accessible at all before this city collapsed. Something is very wrong about the other city...
<P>
There are legends in the books about skystones... They're blue, and they have magical powers. There's a painting of the city, before it was destroyed, and there is a blue ring in the sky... Is that what fell?
<p>
There are legends about an older city, and about older gods... A great god, with a thousand eyes, who destroyed worlds. And there is an older temple, hidden in amongst the older parts of the city, with statues of black winged angels, and scrolls that tell of the end of the world. There are paintings of the servants of the old god... And they look strangely familar.
<p>
Some of the people here look like the ones from the pictures in the old church. There's talk that they have powers... Other people say there's magic here, that the gods brought with them. And the Library has a lot of doors, and some of them go to other worlds... Where did they Library come from? Is Tsiale really a person?
<p>
Some people believe that the scrolls are true... That the end of the world is coming. They think that we're still here because we failed in some way... Our city was destroyed to punish us, just as the city below us was. That the god with a thousand eyes will return and destroy us. Is that what our gods are worrying about?
<p>
Someone says they saw an Angel... No one else was around, but there are black feathers on the ground.
<p>
Those people really are different... The servants of the gods really existed. Did their god exist too? We've been exploring the old city... There are paintings... And machines... Some of the machines are still... alive? The servants of the gods had incredible powers, and we were the rejects, the slaves... They changed us, bred us and colored us so they could tell us apart. And something destroyed them, and their city. How did we survive? The old legends aren't helpful, but it is written that angels descended from the Heavens to destroy them, because they had become impure. The scrolls in the old church say that we were left behind, because we had been found unworthy. Which one is true? Or are they both wrong?
<P>
One of our gods is missing... He's one of the most important, but no one has ever seen him. And the other gods don't talk about him. And I saw the angel last night, too... It's real. Is the old God real, too?
<p>
We don't trust the gods anymore... Someone found out the truth... They're responsible for what happened to our city... Or one of them is... We don't know for sure. Some of us can call on the power of the skystone, like they can... We've mastered enchantments, and recovered some of the old technology, and some of us have the powers that our Masters once did. Do we need the gods to help us anymore?
<p>
Tsiale wanted to bring us guidance after the ring fell... So she summoned gods to take the place of the archetypes of our religion, to aid us and guide us... But they were just people. One of them went insane, and in the battle that followed, our city was destroyed, and our memories and lives were taken away from us. The gods banished him... But he's not dead. I guess you can't kill gods, even if you are a god yourself. Or else they decided not to... But he's still alive, somewhere... And some people are starting to believe what is written in the scrolls. The scrolls tell of false gods, and the evil that lies in books and libraries... The gods want to help us, and make up for what the insane one has done... But they don't seem convinced that it is possible. We'll have to work together... But some of us still don't trust them. And some of us worship the God with a thousand eyes.
<p>
It's much more clear to us now. The "servants of the One", our masters, were fighting a war... They built a war machine, a mechanical god, to destroy their enemies, and it traveled to their world and laid it to waste. And their enemies sent angels to destroy them, and they did... But the angels didn't wipe us out as well... We were the slaves, and we didn't have the powers and sensitivities that they did. But at least one of the angels is still alive... And Kenaan, their machine, their God... Is still here somewhere, as well, asleep. The one of our Gods who went insane wanted to summon it... Still wants to summon it... Now I know what our gods were afraid of. We have the power, now, to end the war our masters started... We have the knowledge to avoid the mistakes they made... And our collective power rivals that of our Gods. I just hope we make the right choice... Whatever the right choice is... But we'll have to make it soon.
