CREATE

Usage: create <type> <name> [description]

Bring a new object of the specified type into existence, using the given name
and, if provided, the description.  The object will be created in your
inventory.  Creation may fail if you are unable to carry it.  Anyone able to
see you or the created object will witness the creation.  The list of type
available for creation is determined from the available IObjectType plugins on
the system.
