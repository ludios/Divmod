Features/Fixed to do:
---------------------
base64 each domain's favicon and embed in exported bookmarks, because ffox supports it

Look for rel="icon" link elements in HTML (some sites, like ours, don't put the icon at /favicon.ico)

Figure out how to deal unicode indexing and search

Display referrer information

Allow blocked domains to be browsed and edited

Implement domain browser that allows visits to domains to be viewed.

Ignore pages with a Content-Length header over a threshold

Some kind of disk space usage statistics

Allow clicky sorting of table by visits, etc.

Charts of activity over time (clicks per hour/day. different sites)

Create queue for indexing and removing from index to defend against
race conditions and batch index changes for effieciency

Visually distinguish each day in history

Calendar view

Make SearchClicks a LivePage, not a live fragment

Allow export of clicks and bookmarks in .zip or email. Use mozilla
bookmark format.

Allow "bookmark this" function from browser and/or clicks list.

Bookmarks view

Build some tagging UI.

Incorporate Alexa info:
