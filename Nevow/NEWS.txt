0.9.3 (2006-07-17):
  - Page rendering now supports preprocessors.

0.9.2 (2006-07-08):
  - Fixes to the typeahead demo.
  - Elements are now automatically serialized by json, just like Fragments.

0.9.1 (2006-07-05):
  - Made nevow.athena.expose the mandatory means of publishing a method to
    the browser.  The allowedMethods dictionary will no longer be respected.
  - Added nevow.page.Element and nevow.athena.LiveElement: these are
    preferred over nevow.rend.Fragment and nevow.athena.LiveFragment for all
    new development.

0.9.0 (2006-06-12):
  - Fixed a bug where nested fragment sending rarely worked.
  - Sending large strings in Athena arguments and results is now faster due to
    less unnecessary unicode character quoting.
  - Module objects are now automatically created for all Athena imports.
  - Better error reporting for fragments which are rendered without a parent.
  - Disconnect notifiers in Athena pages will no longer clobber each other.
  - Many optimizations to javascript initialization.
  - Javascript packages are now defined with less boilerplate: a filesystem
    convention similar to Python's for module naming, plus one declaration in a
    Nevow plugin which indicates the directory, rather than a declaration for
    each module.
  - Updated README to refer to Athena rather than LivePage
