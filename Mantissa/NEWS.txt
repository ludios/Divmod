0.6.5 (2007-07-06):

    the deprecated webtheme.getLoader and via ThemedElement.
  - New inequality-based scrolltable implementation.
  - Themeing support for Athena's "unsupported browser" page now
    provided.
  - JavaScript modules now served from a centralized location for
    public and private pages.

0.6.4 (2007-06-06):
  - LoginPage now remembers and passes on query arguments.
  - Removed use of deprecated API from webadmin.DeveloperSite.

0.6.3 (2007-05-24):

  - Added a method to IOrganizerPlugin to allow notification of
    creation of new person objects.
  - Added a method to IOrganizerPlugin to allow extension of the
    add-person form with new contact information types.
  - Liveform refactoring.

0.6.2 (2007-04-27): 
  - Data passed to Lucene for indexing or search queries is now
    filtered to prevent email addresses and URLs from being recognized
    as single tokens.
  - The sharing API has been significantly revised.
  - PyLucene result sets can now be manipulated without loading large
    numbers of hit objects.

0.6.1 (2007-02-23):
  - Selection and activation tracking has been moved out of Quotient
    and into Mantissa.ScrollTable.
  - Autocomplete has been added, from Quotient.
  - Significant improvements to sharing.
  - webapp.PrivateApplication.__init__ has been removed, in order to
    prevent its privateKey from changing upon upgrade.

0.6.0 (2007-01-23):
  - Several upgraders left out of the previous release have been added.

0.5.27 (2007-01-11):
  - Benefactors have been  removed. Powerups are directly selected by admins
    and grouped into Products (as defined in xmantissa.product). Products 
    are associated with signup mechanisms now, rather than benefactor factories.

    When Products are installed on user stores, Installation items are created 
    to track the installed powerups. Installations may be suspended, which will
    disable the rendering of the web interface of their powerups. Unsuspension 
    will restore them to visibility.

  - Add xmantissa.port module which provides two item classes, TCPPort and
    SSLPort, which can be used to set up and tear down network services in
    a general manner, removing the need to implement service and port logic
    at each point where a TCP or SSL server is desired.

    Provide a web interface for administrators to create and destroy these
    ports in a general way, making network service configuration for all
    mantissa applications that much richer.

    Update command line tools to deal with this change as well, but they do
    not expose the complete flexibility of the new system.
  
    Take note, certificates for SSL services have been copied to a new 
    location in this upgrade. This leaves the original certificate file 
    unchanged but mostly unused.

  - The "Add Person" form will now ensure that only one person can exist with
    any given email address.
    
0.5.26 (2006-12-08):
  - Stylesheets work on HTTP-only servers again.

  - Prefs forms are redisplayed after submission rather than "[Object object]"
  - Only domains currently hosted by the server will be accepted as host parts
    for new usernames.
  - Improved range checking in ScrollTable to avoid IndexErrors.  Also reset
    the scroll tracking property when a ScrollTable is emptied.

  - Images, Javascript and CSS are now served over HTTPS when the page is.

0.5.24 (2006-11-20):
