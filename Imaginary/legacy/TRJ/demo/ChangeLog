	* GuymelefGo.java: Moved verbs from /divunal/tenth/

	* OpenGuymelef.java: Moved verbs from /divunal/tenth/

	* GuymelefLook.java: Moved verbs from /divunal/tenth/

	* FrameSit.java: Construction frame sit verb for Giant Robots.

	* EnterGuymelef.java: Moved verbs from /divunal/tenth/

	* GuestLogin.java: Now gives the guest characters synonyms of
	"guest" and their "color". Well, at least, it didn't do both
	before. now it does.

	* WaterOff.java: Vastly simplified now that FountainDrink does all
	the work.

	* FountainPush.java: Redid the way FountainPush/Drink
	works... Simpler and less hacky now. Contains most of the code for
	the behavior of the fountain, as it should have to begin with.

	* FountainDrink.java: Redid the way FountainDrink works... Simpler
	and less hacky now.

	* BobsFunkyVerb.java: Added the verb from the Make Your Own Verb
	tutorial... I figured it should probably be in the demo, lame as
	it is.

	* DemoOver.java: A 'game over' event for the demo.  This should
	log you out 'n' everything.

	* DollFlush.java: erm.  Spoiler.

1999-12-30  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* WarningOff.java: An event handler to make the Alert rooms go
	back to normal.

	* DispenserLeverPull.java: A silly verb to take the place of the
	toilet paper dispenser verb I never got around to writing and that
	was a stupid idea anyway... Maybe later.

	* ScreenSaverOn.java: Event handler which turns the
	screensaver/password bit back on, hopefully.

	* DemoComputerType.java: Can now be unlocked.

	* DemoComputerLocked.java: This is the verb enabled when the Demo
	Computer is "locked", e.g. in XEmacs, giving out sarcastic
	descriptions instead of doing anything.

	* DemoComputerType.java: Now stores the "password" as a string,
	and has a delete key, so that we can eventually determine if
	they've typed the correct password.

	* ToiletStand.java: You don't need to be able to sit on the
	toilet, really.  Only to stand from it, since that's when the
	magic happens.

	* DemoComputerType.java: small fixes for more intuitiveness after
	a simple play-testing.

1999-12-28  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* DemoComputerType.java: This is a simple silly verb allowing
	people to fail to break into my demo center computer's password
	protected screensaver.

	* Repop.java: Added a verb to manually repop objects on account of
	I'm a lazy bastard after midnight on weekdays.

	* RoachMove.java: Totally reworked behavior to be Location
	friendly. Will probably need a great deal of debugging (no pun
	intended.)

	* BrassWind.java: Fixed some of the potential problems with
	Wind... But we need to redo the way events work, unfortunately.

	* RoachMove.java: Changed the delays around, now uses topRoom()

1999-12-24  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* *.java: Several verbs from Divunal were moved here, since
	they're really being used in the Demo...

	* map.por: actually put the Demo map from the online demo

1999-12-23  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* PagerPress.java: Now much more friendly (and somewhat
	informative) to the painting's receiver being set to null.

	* PaintingDescription.java: Now is much more friendly to strange
	circumstances, such as, say, the person specified as the reciever
	not being in the map.

	* ToySqueeze.java: Squeezy toy verb. You can squeeze it, or
	squeeze it at people or yourself.

	* ToyDrop.java: When you drop Squeezy toys, they squeak.

	* PagerPress.java: A Push/press verb for Pager Paintings... When
	you press the button, the person whose

	* DrawerOpenClose.java: Fixed the comment, and made it not
	screw up the object properties like it used to.

	* DollPull.java: Made the John Romero Action Figure's speech
	a little more interesting.

	Pager Paintings... It shows the subject's current location.
