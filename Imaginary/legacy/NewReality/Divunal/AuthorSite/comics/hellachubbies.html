	<p><B>Panel 1:</b><br><tt>Max and Tenth are walking out of a gate onto a sunny, grass covered hill. Maxwell is holding the Encyclopedia Divunalia, with a large green bookmark protruding from between two of it's pages.)</tt></p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Tenth: "You wanted to make Divunal more appropriate for younger
		audiences, didn't you?"
	  </p>
	  <p>Maxwell: "Hmm. This isn't quite what I had in mind."
	  </p>
	  <p> Tenth: "What do you mean? This sort of thing is very popular with young
		people... They're very playful. Just look over there!"
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><B>Panel 2:</b><br><tt>A nearby hill, where a fat, dirty, unpleasant looking reddish creature is standing. It has a strange, pointy appendage attached to its head, and is holding a crowbar in one hand. It and a similar, greenish thing with a different headpiece are both leering at a flattened, greyish furry thing in the grass.</tt></p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Disembodied Voice: "Ho LOVES to play with bunnies."
	  </p>
	  <p>Green Creature: "Heh heh. Heh. Again, Again."
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><B>Panel 3:</b><br><tt>Back to Tenth, who is staring confusedly off camera, and Maxwell, who is now referring to the marked page in the book.</tt></p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Maxwell: "Well, for one thing, those "Hellachubbies" are probably going to cause us some copywright issues... And aren't we short by one? Where's "dinky stinky"?"
	  </p>
	  <p>Tenth: "Well... Ho hurt him pretty bad with that crowbar. Last time I checked, he was in the dumpster behind the hill with a "sucking chubbie chest wound"."
	  </p>
	  <p>Maxwell: "I see."
	  </p>
