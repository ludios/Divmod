<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>(Note : This is the rough preliminary
version, for Glyph's evaluation. He told me to write down what I knew about
the plot, to the best of my knowledge. The idea was that we'd put something
up here, no matter how bad/wrong it was, and work on it from there. If
you have questions, comments, or requests for changes, just email us.)</FONT></TT></CENTER>

<BR>&nbsp; <P><BR> <P>1,000,000,000,000+ BF (?) : An extremely dense
object of unkown origin explodes in the empty void of space, producing
the expanding pattern of galaxies and solar systems we now refer to as
the Universe.  <P>567,211,045,329 BF: A small wood and brass
bathysphere-like&nbsp; object appears near the center of the universe,
spins in place a few times, and disappears again.  <P>6,000,000,000 BF
: Some of the matter expelled from the super-explosion forms a small,
modest solar system, including a small bluish earthlike planet, later
named "Divu" by its inhabitants.  <P>5,000,000,000 BF : A perfectly
spherical piece of skystone, approximately the size of the earth's
moon, appears out of nowhere and explodes near Divu. A few fragments
of the stone fall to the surface, but most of its mass remains in
orbit, forming a pale bluish ring around the planet.  <P>2,000,000,000
BF (?) : Primitive living organisms appear in the oceans of Divu,
possibly stirred into evolution by the unkown quantum effects of the
skystone explosion miles above the planet.  <P>100,000,000 BF : The
organisms of Divu begin to evolve into species resembling those of
earth, possibly due to the close similarities between the two
planets. A brass and wooden bathysphere-like device appears on an
empty plain on the northern continent of Divu, hums and clicks for a
few minutes, and then disappears once more.  <P>5,000,000 BF :&nbsp;
Divu primates begin to use simple tools and walk upright, and show a
great deal of potential&nbsp; as an intelligent race.  <P>600,000 BF :
The primates finish evolving into a sentient humanoid species, the
Divuthan, who are extremely similar to the <I>homo sapiens</I> of
earth. They are quite intelligent, and extremely sensitive to&nbsp;
electromagnetic energy, which, along with the structure of their
nervous system, allows for a limited form of "telepathy" between
individual members of the species. This later develops into a
language, and ultimately an advanced form of group intelligence,
allowing individual Divuthan to cooperate directly in tasks of
reasoning and computation. A very small percentage of the population,
referred to as the Divu'en, is born without the telepathic abilities
common to the species. While still accepted as part of the culture,
the Divu'ens are seen as genetically defective, and treated almost as
a separate race. The Divu'en become servants and slaves to the
Divuthan, and are forbidden to marry outside their line, in an attempt
to keep their "deformity" from being passed on.

<P>100,000 BF (?) : The divuthan develop complex
technologies and machines, all controlled via telepathy. They have begun
to experiment with the unusual reality-altering properties of the skystone
when their surface colonies encounter an alien race, apparently visiting
from a nearby planet. While the divuthan themselves maintain a peaceful
culture due to their group mentality, they are confused and threatened
by the arrival of "outsiders". The Divuthans' growing xenophobia starts
a number of confrontations, which quickly give way to a full scale war,
although the details thereof are still unclear.
<P>98,000 BF (?) : The divuthan retreat below the
surface, and begin to turn their attention towards improved use of the
skystone and the development of weapons of mass destruction. To this end,
the divus begin limited mining of the ring and develop a series of intelligent
machines, capable of using skystone fragments as a power source, and, ultimately,
an extremely powerful energy weapon. This is an ideal counter to their
enemies' genetically engineered soldier-organisms, which rely on psionics
and are designed to kill living creatures.
<P>96,000 BF (?) :&nbsp; After a long and destructive
war, the divuthan deploy their largest and most advanced autonomous killing
machine,&nbsp; referred to as "Kenaan", which travels to their enemies'
homeworld and razes it to a cold, uninhabitable shell. Their enemies, in
turn, release their most advanced organic hunter-killers on the surface
of Divu. The Huntyres are intelligent, adaptable, and capable of producing
both mental and physical attacks with their psionic abilities. Most of
the Huntyres are destroyed during a climactic battle with the Divuthan's
mechanical defenders, but a good deal of the city and it's population go
with them. The Divuthan's sensitive brains and nervous systems prove extremely
vulnerable to the Huntyre psionic attacks, and practically all of those who
survive and escape the city are of the telepathically handicapped Divu'en
population. The mechanical city is left largely intact, including the cryogenic
suspension tubes (created as a possible way to survive an unsuccessful
war) where the lone surviving Huntyre takes refuge.
<P>95,990 BF : The divuthans' penultimate war machine,
Kenaan, finally returns from its mission,&nbsp; landing "unsuccessfully"
near the southern pole of the planet. The&nbsp; control systems still functioning
in the divuthans' ruined city register it as having crashed, possibly having
suffered an uncontrolled fall from orbit, but suggest that it may still
be operational and waiting for further instructions.
<P>90,000 BF : The survivors of the war, the Divu'en,
begin the slow, painful process of rebuilding their culture. Descended
from the common workers of the Divuthan society, they are unable to reproduce
any of their advanced technology, and lack the telepathic ability to operate
it. Without the Divuthan group intelligence to govern them, the Divu'en
scatter across the continent, struggling to survive in their comparatively
harsh new environment.
<P>10,000 BF : The Divu'en have forgotten most of
their past in their struggle to survive. Their societies have become fairly peaceful,
having been founded by the civilians of a society destroyed by war, and
they are also extremely distrustful of technology and weapons. Their history
survives only in legends of warring gods, avenging angels, and the skystone-bearing
rulers who would return again someday, when the Divu'en had proved themselves
worthy.
<P>3,000&nbsp; BF : The Divu'en continue their social
development. While the stories of the power inherent in the skystone (and
the blue ring around Divu) still circulate, it has been quite some time
since this power has made itself apparent. Other forms of religion have
developed, including a monotheistic doomsday cult, fortelling a return
of the One whose servants destroyed the Divuthan, and a more popular polytheistic
following based on societal archetypes. Legends begin to circulate about
the rare blue "skystone", and the great magical powers it can grant to
the Divu'en&nbsp; who are able to control it... However, these individuals
(e.g. modern Divuthan) are few and far between. The scattered populations
of the northern continent begin to unify, following the traditions of group
mentality, even if lacking the ability itself.
<P>500 BF : The Divu'en, having reached somewhat
of a Golden Age in terms of their peace and prosperity, set about building
the great city of Uth, a symbol of peace, unity, and progress. The militant,
scroll-bearing followers of The One are still attempting to gain a following
in their attempts to bring about the end of the world, but fortunately
for society at large, they have been extremely unsuccessful.
<P>100 BF :&nbsp; While somewhat modernized, the
great city of Uth still stands proudly on the northern continent of Divu,
and has reached a state of technological advancement roughly equal to that
of 19th century europe. The Divu'en have deep cultural objections to weapons
technology, but have made a number of advances in medicine, astrology,
and science, particularly computer technology, and seek to further the
exploration of their planet.
<P>5 BF : Divu'en astronomers have noticed changes
in the attitude and rotational period of the skystone ring surrounding
the planet, suggesting that it's orbit is decaying rapidly. The ammount
of "falling sky" has increased, amd the glowing streaks of atmospheric
re-entry are seen as terrible omens for the near future. The followers
of the One begin to come out of hiding and gleefully prepare themselves
for the end of the world. Meanwhile, in the city of Uth, a religious young
woman named Tsiale&nbsp; fullfills her lifelong dream of owning a bookstore.
She is fascinated by legends of the past, particularly those of the powers
granted by the skystones, and believes quite strongly that she is favored
by that power.
<P>0 : The ring begins to fall. While some Uth'ens
flee their homes and seek refuge in the catacombs under the city,Tsiale
remains in her bookstore, convinced that it will protect her. A few days
later, the shower of skystone meteorites decimates the city of Uth, and
one of the largest intact pieces of stone strikes Tsiale's bookstore, razing
it to the ground.
<P>0 : In the wake of the fall, the followers of
the One are dismayed to find themselves alive, still bound to their imperfect
world with the rest of the non-believers. Cursing the dwellers of Uth and
their heathen religion, the followers vow to uphold the mandates written
in their scrolls, and bring about the end of the world as it was intended.
Meanwhile, in Uth, a single bookcase, perfectly intact, has appeared in
the rubble of Tsiale's home.
<P>0 :&nbsp; The survivors of the fall find begin
to sift through the wreckage of their city, and find the remains of a bookstore,
nearly intact despite the ruined streets around it. Fearing it to be haunted,
they give it a wide berth.
<P>1 : Tsiale finds herself in her bookstore, just
as she had remembered it. Though her body was destroyed in the impact,
the skystone reacted to her strong will, and preserved the essence of her
mind and beliefs. She and her bookstore are now one and the same, and while
she cannot leave its walls, it is still expanding, even though it appears
the same as it always was when viewed from the outside.
<P>2 : The bookstore continues to expand, connecting
to other bookstores in other worlds and dimensions. In the hopes of saving
her people, Tsiale calls out through the bookstore, attempting to find
someone with the force of will to control the power of the skystone. At
the same time, on earth, Maxwell, a successful but troubled science fiction
author currently in the midst of the 10th book of the ill-fated DeathBlaster
trilogy, becomes lost in a fairly small bookstore and suddenly finds himself
in a much larger one.
<P>3 : Maxwell learns what he can from the elusive
Tsiale, explores Uth, and learns what he can about this "Divunal", the
world of the fallen ring. He also experiments with the powers granted to
him by the skystone, which allow him to make his writings and drawings
into reality. 
<P>4 : After beginning to help the Uth'ens rebuild
their city, Maxwell learns of Tsiale's intent to fullfill the tenets of
her religion, providing her people with the godly archetypes of their religion
(Maxwell being the storyteller). With her help, Maxwell summons his friend
John to Divunal. Maxwell's hope is that John, a devout Christian, has
the moral responsibility to properly help the Divunalians, and the strength
of will and belief needed to harness the power of the skystone.
<P>6 : A strange man appears in a wooden and metal bathysphere-like device,&nbsp;
and asks Maxwell some unusual questions. He appears to be another human,
albeit one who is visiting out of chronological sequence
with his own arrival on Divunal. He is extremely evasive about his origins
and motivation, but seems to be rather worried about something that he is
not entirely able to describe. For lack of a better name, Maxwell begins
referring to him simply as the Tenth Archetype.
<P>5 : John is bewildered by the new world he has
been shown, and is at once fascinated and horrified by the powers he possesses
there. While his is eager to help the people of Divunal at first, he becomes
disturbed by the similarity between the events he has witnessed, and to
certain events depicted in the new testament. Ceasing in his interest to
build a perfect heavenly world for the Uth'ens, he becomes more and more
withdrawn in his studies, and soon ceases to talk to Maxwell and Tsiale entirely.
<P>6 : John, starved and delerious, attempts to "save" the population
of Divunal by sounding the horns of judgement, summoning the four
horsemen of the Apocalypse, and bringing about the end of the
world. Tsiale calls the population of the city into the library, in
the hopes of protecting them, while Maxwell and the other "gods" fight
to save what is left of the city. Maxwell emerges victorious, but all
the color has drained out from him, and can still be seen on the steps
leading up to John's half-completed heaven. It is unclear what Maxwell
has done with John after defeating him, but he may very well still be
alive. "Tenth" is nowhere to be found, having faced off against the massive
device John had summoned in place of War (Kenaan), and disappeared in a 
burst of energy along with his opponent.
<P>7 : Maxwell vows never to summon anyone else to
Divunal, and busies himself creating his castle, with its skystone chamber
and throne. Tsiale, having recovered from the battle with John, has already
decided otherwise, as Divunal is more in need of help now than it has ever
been before. Over the course of the next few years,Tsiale, and eventually,
Maxwell, continue to summon the rest of the gods, including Tenth, who
bears a passing resemblance to the strange man in the bathysphere.
<P>8 : Jedin excavates an entrance to the Divuthan mechanical city,
which has become accessible from the catacombs beneath Uth after
John's attempt to split the city in two. In the process of his
explorations, he reawakens Huntyre, who is rather surprised by the
development but refrains from killing him immediately, since his task
has been completed, and Jedin bears little resemblance to the enemy he
was designed to destroy.
<P>(Beginning of the Commercial Game) : The first
of the Uth'ens Tsiale called into the library begin to awaken and return
to their world, although they have lost their memories.
