0.9.12 (2006-10-17):
  - Added id rewriting for LiveElement and LiveFragment, such that id
    attributes in a widget template are rewritten so that they are unique to 
    the widget instance. A client-side API, Nevow.Athena.Widget.nodeById(), 
    is provided to allow location of these nodes.

0.9.11 (2006-10-10):
  - Fixed dynamic widget instantiation in IE.
  - Added support for correctly quoting the values of slots which are used as
    attributes.

0.9.10 (2006-10-05):
  - Minor update to nevow.testutil.

0.9.9 (2006-09-26):
  - Several nit changes, including the addition of the "check" method to 
    Failure, and the addition of an "assertFailure" method.
  - The ability to pass Python exceptions to Javascript has been added to 
    Athena.
  - Dynamic module import has been added for the cases where it is necessary
    to dynamically add a widget to an existing page.
  
0.9.8 (2009-09-20):
  - A bug in nit that caused it to fail if there were too many tests in a 
    test case, and swallow failures in some cases, has been fixed.
  - Widgets can no longer be added to a page after render time using
    Divmod.Runtime.Platform.{set,append}NodeContent.  Instead, they must be
    added using Nevow.Athena.Widget.addChildWidgetFromWidgetInfo.

0.9.7 (2009-09-12):
  - Automatic Athena event handler registration is fixed for all supported browsers
    and is no longer document-sensitive (ie, it works inside tables now).
  - Nit has gained a new assertion method, assertIn.

0.9.6 (2008-08-30):
  - Fixed a bug in the IE implementation of the runtime.js node fetching
    functions.

0.9.5 (2006-08-22):
  - Instance attributes can now be exposed to Athena with nevow.utils.Expose
    and Expose.exposedMethodNames() no longer returns unexposed names.

0.9.4 (2006-08-14):
  - Added test method discovery to nit test cases, so multiple test methods
    may be put in a single test case.
  - use XPath for certain DOM traversals when available. This yields
    significant speedups on Opera.
  - Made Divmod.Runtime.Platform.getAttribute deal with IE attribute
    name-mangling properly.
  - Javascript logging is now done in Firebug 0.4 style rather than 0.3.
  - Some cases where Deferred-returning render methods raised
    exceptions or buried failures were fixed.
  - Removed MochiKit. The pieces Nevow depends on have been moved to
    Divmod.Base in nevow/base.js.
  - Various doc fixes.

0.9.3 (2006-07-17):
  - Page rendering now supports preprocessors.

0.9.2 (2006-07-08):
  - Fixes to the typeahead demo.
  - Elements are now automatically serialized by json, just like Fragments.

0.9.1 (2006-07-05):
  - Made nevow.athena.expose the mandatory means of publishing a method to
    the browser.  The allowedMethods dictionary will no longer be respected.
  - Added nevow.page.Element and nevow.athena.LiveElement: these are
    preferred over nevow.rend.Fragment and nevow.athena.LiveFragment for all
    new development.

0.9.0 (2006-06-12):
  - Fixed a bug where nested fragment sending rarely worked.
  - Sending large strings in Athena arguments and results is now faster due to
    less unnecessary unicode character quoting.
  - Module objects are now automatically created for all Athena imports.
  - Better error reporting for fragments which are rendered without a parent.
  - Disconnect notifiers in Athena pages will no longer clobber each other.
  - Many optimizations to javascript initialization.
  - Javascript packages are now defined with less boilerplate: a filesystem
    convention similar to Python's for module naming, plus one declaration in a
    Nevow plugin which indicates the directory, rather than a declaration for
    each module.
  - Updated README to refer to Athena rather than LivePage
