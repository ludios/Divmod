	* SpellRead.java: addAbility now shouldn't throw exceptions so much!

1999-12-22  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* divunal/common/Stand.java: Added first version of the separate "get off of
	furniture" verb, to prevent verb collisions.

	* divunal/common/SitAt.java: No longer has potentially conflictory stand/go
	synonyms, and relies on a separate Stand/Go verb.

	* divunal/common/Sit.java: No longer has potentially conflictory stand/go
	synonyms, and relies on a separate Stand/Go verb.

	* divunal/common/Lie.java: No longer has potentially conflictory stand/go
	synonyms, and relies on a separate Stand/Go verb.

1999-12-21  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* divunal/common/OpenCloseContainer.java: Now doesn't mess with
	broadcast! A good thing. We should put this (or maybe a more
	wieldily named version of it) into twisted.reality.plugin
	sometime. And what the hell... Now it will also check for "open
	description" and "closed description" elements.

1999-12-13  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* divunal/tenth/WatchDraw.java: Now automatically renames numbered
	objects, and lets you know what number you're on... We might want
	to consider making draw do this by default, or maybe have a
	synonym that does... Stuff to think about.

	* divunal/tenth/SpectacleSet.java: Now turn into X-Ray Spectacles(tm) if you set
	them to be blue, a la "Tomorrow Is Not Enough". Thanks, Rikyu. ;-)

1999-12-11  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* divunal/common/author/ShadowStep.java: Added first
	version... Allows you to quickly move to the location of your
	current location, if available, or into Rooms that are in your
	current Location.

	* divunal/rikyu/XRayVision.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

	* divunal/rikyu/WhoWhere.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

	* divunal/rikyu/UseGondola.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

	* divunal/rikyu/TeaHouseOpen.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

	* divunal/rikyu/TapestryMove.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

	* divunal/rikyu/SummonGondola.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

	* divunal/rikyu/SmokePipe.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

	* divunal/rikyu/FireplacePassage.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

	* divunal/rikyu/Drift.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() that we just made.

1999-12-10  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* divunal/common/author/SpeechNotify.java: Now looks nicer, and
	turns off automagically when you start talking again (and allows
	you to see the first thing you said. ;-)

	* divunal/common/author/Listen.java: Added a verb to turn
	SpeechNotify on and off.

	* divunal/common/author/SpeechNotify.java: Added first version of
	an event handler that will inform gods that they are being
	addressed with a response request window (a la AOLIM). Eventually,
	this might make them able to respond back, and I'll also make a
	verb allowing you to turn it on and off more easily.

1999-12-07  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* divunal/rikyu/WanderHandler.java: Fixed this to use vectors rather than
	stacks, since *which* Stack class was being used differed from VM
	version to version and was ambiguous...

1999-12-05  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* divunal/common/author/Visit.java: Started remembering to use
	the Changelog... Changed the order of "Concentration" and
	"Streaks" descriptive text, so it wouldn't look weird if you
	teleported to another point in the same room.

1999-11-07  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added ChangeLog so future changes can be logged.
