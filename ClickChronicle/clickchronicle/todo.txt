Features/Fixed to do:
---------------------
Empty signup causes exception

Visually distinguish each day in history

Calendar view

Figure out how to deal with unicode display, indexing and search

Make SearchClicks a LivePage, not a live fragment

Write some tests - need to use ccapp.py to create in-memory db and add
visits, domain, ignores, etc.

Allow export of clicks and bookmarks in .zip or email. Use mozilla
bookmark format.

Implement domain browser that allows visits to domains to be viewed.

Allow blocked domains to be browsed and edited

Allow "bookmark this" function from browser and/or clicks list.

Build some tagging UI.

Implement "exits from this page" option in extention.

Create queue for indexing and removing from index to defend against
race conditions and batch index changes for effieciency

Logout link to __logout__

Display favicon

Charts of activity over time

Display referrer information

Bookmarks view

Display username at the top of the page. Make sure it's visible at
initial login/ticket claim e.g "set password for amir@divmod.com"

Remember "per page" setting e.g. don't reset to 10 when user clicks
"my clicks". Also consider removing 100 as an option due to
performance reasons
