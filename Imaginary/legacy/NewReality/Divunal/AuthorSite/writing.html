<center><b><font size=+4>Writing For Divunal</font></b></center>

<p>
<br>
<p>
The basic requirement for creating new things in the game, be they rooms, characters, or objects, is some degree of writing ability. Descriptive text is an unusual style of writing, and can be difficult to master... but if you can read this page, you're probably literate and fluent in English, which is all you really need to get started.
<p>
But before we talk about writing descriptions, we're going to go over the etiquette of creating new objects. This information is also summarized in the description for the Draw verb, but it's a very important part in the design of any object, so make sure you understand the concepts involved.
<p>
<b>Naming Things</b>
<blockquote>When you create a new object, you should be giving it a unique name. Names like "key", "door", or "sofa" are too generic, and very difficult to distinguish from other similar objects. In some cases, an adjective or two will suffice, like "rusty iron key", or "old wooden door", but it can also be helpful to make the name more descriptive, such as "mansion bedroom key", or "elven sword of great antiquity".
<p>
If you decide you don't like the name you've given an existing object, but don't want to have to Erase it and start over, you can simply change the name with the name command by typing:
<blockquote>
<tt>name &lt;object name> to &lt;new name></tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is quite possible (and desirable) to give the object a separate "apparent" name, to keep the name from giving away too much information, by assigning it a name string. While the object will now appear to have the new name, it's global name is unchanged, and it can still be referred to by it. You can accomplish this by typing:
<blockquote>
<tt>string name on &lt;real object name> to &lt;apparent name></tt>
</blockquote>
This is a very helpful feature, and can be used on any Thing in Divunal, including rooms. For example, if I wanted to make a key for the asylum closet door, but I didn't want the player to immediately know what the key was for, I would type the following commands:
<blockquote>
<tt> draw <font color="#000000">asylum closet key</font></tt>
<p>
<tt> string name on asylum closet key to small metal key</tt>
<p>
</blockquote>
Now, I would have an asylum closet key, but it would appear as small metal key to normal observers. Just remember that it is still named asylum closet key, and that it can still be referred to by that name.
</blockquote>
<b>Referencing and Synonyms</b>
<blockquote>While we're on the subject of making new objects, it is also important to give your objects synonyms, to make them easier to use and interact with. Adding synonyms will not change the appearance of an object, but it will allow characters to refer to it by different names. Given that a unique object name is usually two or three words long, it's usually not very easy to type, both for you and anyone else who has to deal with it.&nbsp; At the very least, your object should have a one-word version of it's name as a synonym, and you should feel free to add a few more for good measure. For example:
<blockquote>
<tt> draw mechanical brass cockroach</tt>
<p>
<tt> reference mechanical brass cockroach to cockroach</tt>
<p>
<tt> reference mechanical brass cockroach to brass cockroach</tt>
<p>
<tt> reference mechanical brass cockroach to roach</tt>
</blockquote>
This allows the mechanical brass cockroach to be referred to as "brass cockroach", "cockroach", or "roach", in addition to its full name. "cockroach" is definitely important, as it is the most common abbreviation of the name. I also added "brass cockroach" in case I want to be able to distinguish between various metals without typing in "mechanical" as well. "roach" is the least necessary synonym, but it's a fairly intuitive abbreviation of the name, and it makes the author's life a lot easier.&nbsp; :-)

<b>Writing Descriptive Text</b>
<blockquote>
When writing the description of an object or room, there are a few Do's and Don'ts to keep in mind.
<p>
<b><u>DO:</u></b>
<blockquote>
<b>Try to describe your subject clearly and vividly.</b> It often helps to visualize the thing you are attempting to describe in your mind, and work from there. What makes it distinctive? Which features stand out the most? What words come to mind when you think of it? Asking yourself questions about the thing you want to describe can help to make the description clearer.
<p>
<b>Attempt to keep your description reasonably short and to-the-point.</b> It's good to write detailed descriptions that give the viewer a clear picture of the thing in question, but it's&nbsp; bad if that description is so long that the viewer gives up halfway through it out of boredom. As a general rule of thumb, you should try to keep the description of commonly viewed things, like rooms, fairly short and simple, but you should feel free to embellish special objects and descriptive elements.<b></b>
<p>
<b>Practice, practice, practice. Writing lots of descriptions is really the only way to get better. </b>Some people practice by thinking up descriptions for places and things they come across in real life... But you can also learn a lot just by looking at other people's descriptions in the game. If you see a description that really seems to work well, try to figure out why it is so effective; If you find a really bad description, see if you can put your finger on what makes it so terrible.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want examples of "good" descriptive text, try getting away from your computer for a while and reading a book... Preferably a good one, of course, but even badly written text can be a valuable experience if you take the time to figure out why you didn't like it.
</blockquote>
<b><u>DON'T:</u></b>
<blockquote>
<b>Describe anything actively occurring in the object's description, unless it should always be happening.</b> It is quite possible to have parts of the description react to events and timing, and you should look into that rather than describe "leaves blowing around violently in the wind" in an area, or a character "giving you a cold stare" whenever you look at them. An event mentioned in a description will always appear to be happening, and it really looks cheesy... There are cases where this is appropriate (perpetual motion machines, water tumbling over a waterfall, etc.) but these are very specific sorts of cases. Remember that the Twisted Reality engine has a lot of nifty interactive features, and that you could probably make a "real", working version of the effect you wanted to describe if you just put in a little more effort.
<p>
<b>Inform the viewer as to how they are reacting to the thing being described.</b> This is denying the viewer the opportunity to roleplay their own reaction, another form of including an action inside a description, and essentially a real cop-out; If you want to have a profound effect on the viewer, you should write the description in such a way that it inspires the reaction you want in the player. There are a few instances where this might be desirable (Gods, supernatural creatures, and illusions which directly affect the character's mind), but even these are often better as special events or viewer-specific effects. After all, even if a character's appearance magically causes viewers to gasp in awe, it becomes cheesy,&nbsp; contrived, and annoying if the viewer is told that they gasp in awe <i>every single time</i> they look at the character. Writing a description that inspires awe in the viewer is difficult, but much more rewarding.
<p>
<b>Write descriptions that rely on references to the "real world". </b>Divunal takes place a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, and the characters have had no exposure to earth or it's culture. While Divunal and Earth have common features in their societies and technology, you should avoid using specifics in your descriptions. The game is written in English, and you should feel free to take things for granted if they also exist in Divunal... The sky, metal, stone, wood, and even steam engines are all things that a Divu'en would recognize... however, a Gutenberg press, a hub cap, an American flag, or an X-Files poster would not be. This doesn't mean that those items couldn't appear in the game somewhere, in one of the many worlds the characters could visit, but they could not be referred to that simply. (While the Divunalians have comparable technology, the Gutenberg press is a specific design, and they definitely wouldn't refer to it by the same name that we do. A hub cap would simply appear to be a convex metal disk with a number of holes, as the Divunalians would not recognize it as being part of an automobile, since they don't have anything like an automobile in their culture. The American flag would probably be recognized as a red white and blue striped flag, but not as "American". The X-Files poster would appear to be a strange portrait of a red-headed woman and a taller, solemn looking man on a dark green and black background, since the&nbsp;Fox network (and television itself) are unknown on Divunal.)
