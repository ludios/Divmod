The New New New Twisted Reality
===============================

This is formally Complete Rewrite #5 of the Twisted Reality (AKA "reality
pencil") engine that has never quite worked.

While I usually detest calling things "new", this one does have the unique
distinction of being loosely based on Zope Corporation's "New Religion" object
model.  I was originally planning to call the module "Heresy", but that might
have been a bit too obscure.
