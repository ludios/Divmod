<center><b><font size=+4>Creating Things In Divunal</font></b>,<BR>
A Quick Tutorial for Deities</center>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some authors have complained about the high learning curve in creating things for Divunal, so I've decided to summarize the basics again. This covers a number of topics, starting with basic object creation and naming, up to creating more complicated types of objects, like locations and characters.
<p>
The tutorial currently includes the following sections: 
<blockquote>

They were intended to be read in order, but there is a certain degree of redundancy in most of the topics. Still, you should skim them all at least once... You might learn something. ;-)

<a name = "making things">
<b>Making Things</b>
<blockquote>Creating basic objects in Divunal is very simple. By basic, I mean a Thing... Not a Playable Character, or a Location (an object that other objects can be inside of). The syntax is "draw <i>NameOfThing</i>". It's very easy. For example, type:
<code>
<blockquote>draw extruded plastic dingus</blockquote>
</code>
To draw an extruded plastic dingus. To draw a serrated metal toothbrush, type "draw serrated metal toothbrush". If this step is giving you trouble, you probably need a god account, god character, and/or godly creation implements, and should talk to Tenth, Maxwell, or just about any other god about getting them. </blockquote>
<a name = "naming things">
<b>Naming Things</b>
<blockquote>You should give your things fairly specific and unique names; Unless the name is a word of your own creation, it should probably be fairly complicated and specific. For example, you shouldn't make a door called "door", or a sword called "sword". Don't worry, though... If you want your object to appear to be generic, we'll tell you how to do that soon. Some examples of bad names are:
<code><blockquote>key, door, room, player, box, pen, feather, amulet, rock
</code></blockquote>
Some examples of good names:
<code><blockquote>asylum closet key, tenth's bedroom door, asylum closet door, Odaliae, battered wooden crate, black fountain pen, Huntyre's feather, amulet of Kenaan, dark grey stone
</blockquote></code>
You can change a Thing's name at any time with the "name" command. While this is a simple procedure, you should be careful when using it; Objects are identified by their names, and changing it frequently can be confusing.
<blockquote><code>
name battered brass lantern to old brass lantern
</blockquote></code>
Will change the name of the battered brass lantern to "old brass lantern". Just substitute the name of your object, and the name you want it to be, and you're all set.
</blockquote>
<a name = "referencing things">
<b>Referencing Things</b>
<blockquote>This is a very important step, overlooked or glossed over in the creation of an embarassing number of objects, including some of my own. When you create an object, it can be referred to by it's name (i.e. "get asylum closet key") but only by it's name. It's complete name, mind you, which is often a pain in the ass to type. In order to make other names (or "aliases") for your objects, use the reference command. For example:
<code>
<blockquote> reference small brass key to key<BR>reference small brass key to small key<BR>reference small brass key to brass key</blockquote>
</code>
Will allow the key to be referred to as key, small key, or brass key, in addition to it's true name. If you neglect to reference your objects, to at least the extent of giving them a simple, obvious, one word abbreviation, it makes the game much harder to use, look like a bad Zork spin-off, and will cause players to dislike and avoid anything you create. And not in a "good way", either.
<blockquote><i>Note: This has some other interesting effects: If I am in a room with a small brass key, a small silver key, and a small gold key, and I type "get key", I will hear "Which key? The small brass key, the small silver key, or the small gold key?". Properly referencing your objects means that the player can use the obvious solution ("get brass key") and it will work.</i></blockquote>
In the event that you make a mistake or change your mind, you can remove a reference by typing "unreference object to alias", where object is the object in question, and alias is the extra name you no longer want it to have.
<P>
As a reminder, be careful when changing the name of your objects... If you change the name of the abovementioned "small brass key" to "large strontium key", it will still have it's references. Meaning that you can still refer to it as "brass key". If you change the name of an object, you should delete references that no longer apply, and add new ones to reflect the changes to the name.
</blockquote>
<a name = "apparent names">
<b>Assigning Apparent Names</b><blockquote>
This is an optional step, but is very handy when you want to make an object look more generic than it is. it's a slightly more complicated task than the others we've looked at so far, but try and bear with us:
<code>
<blockquote>draw horn of Roland<BR>string name on horn of roland to ornate horn</blockquote>
</code>
The draw command creates a horn of Roland object, of course. The second command creates a String variable on it, which contains the text "ornate horn". The end result is that while the horn of Roland is still truly the horn of Roland, and can be referred to as such, it's name appears as "ornate horn" on everyone's screen. <b>However, Remember that</b> this is not a real name... You still need to add it as a reference before people can refer to it as ornate horn. Also, if you give it a name string of "fancy hooter", you should give it additional references to reflect it's apparent name ("fancy hooter" and "hooter" in addition to "horn").<blockquote><i>Note: This can produce an interesting side effect. If you draw three different key objects, and give them all an apparent name of "key", and try to refer to one, such as in "get key", instead of saying "What do you mean? The key, the key, or the key?" the game will instead choose a key at random. Assigning a name string is actually the only way to make two objects appear to have the same name, since all true names must be unique.</i></blockquote>
You can remove the apparent name from an object at any time by typing "killprop name on hooter", although if your object isn't called hooter, you probably shouldn't copy my example directly.
<P>
Remember that the real name, apparent name, and aliases are all different things. If you change the horn's name to "nose flute of Roland", it will still appear to be called "ornate horn". You can always use the "scrutinize" command to see the current state of the object if you get confused.
</blockquote>
<a name = "describing objects">
<b>Describing Objects</b><blockquote>
You MUST describe your objects. The only exception to this are cases where you give the object a special dynamic property or verb that replaces the description or intercepts the player's intention to look at it... So unless you're cool with doing that, describe it.
<code>
<blockquote>draw full metal jacket<br><br>describe full metal jacket</blockquote>
</code>
A window will pop up, displaying the current description of the full metal jacket. You can edit this description to your heart's content, and then save it by clicking Okay, or Cancel if you decide you like it the way it is. Needless to say, you can also use the Describe command to change existing descriptions.<P>
Writing a good description does involve writing, as the phrase implies, and you're bad at that, you may want to practice. In 50 words or less, descriptions shouldn't be longer than they need to be, shouldn't describe actions or motions occuring while you watch, give a good idea of what your character is seeing, and not rely on references to things from real life, as Divunal is intended to be an immersive fantasy world. (When in doubt, look at other descriptions, or read a good book for inspiration.
</blockquote>
<a name = "sketching advanced things">
<b>Sketching Advanced Things</b><blockquote>
The draw command always creates Things. Which is nice, because everything is a Thing, but also limited, in that some things are also Locations, Rooms, or Players, but Things which you create with Draw will just be things.<p>
You can create specialized objects using the Sketch command. Sketch will provide you with the code for a default object, and you can change it as you wish. Until you get to be a buff Java stallion, you'll probably just want to use sketch to create a specific class of Thing. For example:
<code>
<blockquote>sketch polished steel bucket</blockquote>
</code>
will open a window, showing something along the lines of:
<code>
<blockquote>
Thing<BR>
{<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp name "polished steel bucket"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp place "Mansion Bucket Room"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp describe "A blue box."<BR>
}</blockquote>
</code>
If you click okay at this point, it will creates a bucket object, just as if you had typed "draw polished steel bucket". However, you can change the code first. As I mentioned above, that can get hairy, but you will find it worth your while to change the first word (which will always begin as "Thing"). For example, you could change it to "Location", so that the code looks something like:
<code>
<blockquote>
Location <BR>
{<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp name "polished steel bucket"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp place "Mansion Bucket Room"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp describe "A blue box."<BR>
}</blockquote>
</code>
Now, you have created a bucket much as if you had used "draw polished steel bucket", except that it is now a location, and capable of having other objects inside it. It also has all the cool methods that Locations have (See the <a href = "http://www.twistedmatrix.com/reality/pumpdoc/twisted.reality.Location.html#_top_">TR API Docs</a> for more information on this). But that's Java programming stuff, so if you aren't a programmer, don't get your panties in a knot about it.
<P>
You can use the "scrutinize" command to examine objects you have created. This allows you to see all of the variables and values that the object contains, in a self contained browsing window. For example:
<blockquote><code>
scrutinize bucket
</blockquote></code>
Will open a window, very much like what you get from "sketch". You can only make changes to the code when you are creating a new object with "sketch", but "scrutinize" will allow you to check an object's properties, and will be very helpful in determining if something is horribly wrong with it.
<P>
Using this technique, you can also create <b>Players</b> and <b>Rooms</b>, by replacing the word "Thing" with the word "Player" or the word "Room", instead of "Location". However, creating these things is only the beginning of what you need to do to make them work the way you'd probably like them to. Observe:</blockquote>
<a name = "creating containers">
<b>Creating Containers</b><blockquote>
Creating a container is fairly simple if you've been reading along this whole time... If you've skipped here, you're a lazy bastard; But just to refresh your memory, type "sketch foozle" where foozle would be replaced by the name of your desired object, and then, when the sketch window pops up, change the word "Thing" to the word "Location" and click the "Okay" button.
<P>
Well, you've got a Location now, but it's virtually indistinguishable from a Thing at this point. To make it more interesting, type
<code>
<blockquote>enable pocket universe to twisted.reality.plugin.Put</blockquote>
</code>
With your location's name in place of "pocket universe", of course. Now, you have a Location, which is enabled with the Put verb, allowing you to Get, Take, and Put things in and out of it. So in effect, you have a container, i.e. an object that you can put things into and take things out of.
<p>
If you want to be totally K-Rad about it, you can also enable it with another verb, like this one:
<code>
<blockquote>enable pocket universe to divunal.common.OpenCloseContainer</blockquote>
</code>
This enables the pocket universe to use an Open/Close verb, so that people can open or close it by, for example, typing "open pocket universe". When it's closed, the contents will be hidden from view and inaccessible, and it will function normally while open.</blockquote>
<a name = "creating rooms">
<b>Creating Rooms</b><blockquote>
You have two main options when creating a new room: You can create it in such a way that it is connected to the Room you are currently in, or you can make it isolated from everything else. We'll cover these in order, to make your life interesting.
<code>
<blockquote>sketch Bob's New Room</blockquote>
</code>
This will open a sketch window, as we have already learned. In this case, you should see something like:
<code><blockquote>
Thing<BR>
{<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp name "Bob's New Room"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp place "Bob's Old Room"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp describe "A blue box."<BR>
}</blockquote></code>
And you will need to do two things: <b>1:</b> Change the word "Thing" to "Room", and <b>2:</b> delete the "place" line. The end product should look something like this:
<code><blockquote>
Room<BR>
{<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp name "Bob's New Room"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp describe "A blue box."<BR>
}</blockquote></code>
Except with the appropriate name. Now, click "Okay". This will have no immediately obvious effect, since the new Thing is a Room, and it isn't in the Room that you are currently in, so you can't see it. It does exist, though... You can visit it by typing:
<code><blockquote>
gate north to Bob's New Room
</blockquote></code>
Where "north" needs to be a direction in which there is not already an exit, and "Bob's New Room" is the name of your room. This will create a new, temporary magical exit leading to your room. Once you arrive there, you should Describe it, and fill it with interesting stuff.
<blockquote><i>Note that you can always refer to the room you are currently in as "here".</i></blockquote>
Now... You're probably in a room with no exits, since you just created the room, and it isn't connected to anything. That's okay, though, because we're about to cover the other way to create new rooms. Type:
<blockquote><code>
dig north to Bob's Other New Room
</blockquote></code>
This creates a new Room, called "Bob's Other New Room", and creates an exit leading north from the room you arein that will bring you to it. "Bob's Other New Room" will also have a south exit leading back into the room you are in now. Using Dig, you can create as many Rooms as you want, and they will all be connected to one another as you would expect them to be. You should still describe them, though, or the word will be spread far and wide that your rooms look like ass, and no one will visit them again. No, really. Mark my words.
<p>
As a closing remark on rooms and exits, you should be familiar with the "tunnel" and "barricade" commands. You can create an exit leading from one room another by typing:
<blockquote><code>
tunnel east to Bob's Old Bathroom
</blockquote></code>
Where east is the desired direction, followed by "to" and the name of the room you are tunneling to. This <u>only creates a one-way exit</u>, however, so you should do it from both sides if you are creating a new doorway. But this is the best way to create one-way exits. The other way to make a one way exit is to close off one side of a two way exit, by typing
<blockquote><code>
barricade north
</blockquote></code>
If north was the direction you wanted to close off the exit to. This allows you to remove unwanted exits, and make the standard two-way exits into one way exits by removing one of the "ways".</blockquote>
<a name = "creating component objects">
<b>Creating Component Objects For Rooms</b><blockquote>
You can make an object into a permanent part of the room (a "component", if you will) with the nail command. Component objects are not listed in the room's contents, and cannot be taken, although they can be looked at and otherwise interacted with. The classical example is
<blockquote><code>
draw marble statue of John<BR><BR>nail marble statue of John
</blockquote></code>
Which will create a Thing, and then make it a part of the room. It also gives you the opportunity to break the ice at parties by talking about that time you went to Divunal and nailed a statue. You can un-componentize an object with the "yank" command, a la
<blockquote><code>
yank marble statue of John
</blockquote></code>
It is important to remember what your object was called, or else you'll have trouble finding it again... This is another point in favor of referencing your objects correctly.
<p>
Normally, you should mention components in the description of the
room; They won't be listed in the list of contents, so players will
have no other way of knowing that they are present. You could also be really
sneaky, and not mention the object in the description, although it
would have to be a pretty obvious object if you want players to find
it (or not be confused and annoyed by it being there). For example,
<blockquote><code> draw Bob's Bathroom Floor<BR><BR> string name on
Bob's Bathroom Floor to Bathroom Floor<BR><BR> reference Bob's
Bathroom Floor to floor<BR><BR> describe floor<BR><BR> <i>A
description box pops up, and I change it to "The floor is covered in
small scratches, a few of which seem to have been made
intentionally. You also notice what appears to be a letter "B" gouged
into the floor near the western wall of the room."</i><BR><BR> nail
floor<BR><BR> describe here<BR><BR> <i>A description box pops up, and
I change it to "A small, dingy bathroom, dusty with neglect. The
greenish wallpaper is stained and torn, and the floor is scuffed and
marked in several places."</i> </blockquote></code> An observant
and/or curious player might consider looking at the floor, and be
rewarded with an extra bit of description, and a clue. (I might do
something special with the western wall, or the letter B later on in
this puzzle.) Component Objects are also a good way to break up the
description of a room. You can mention a specific feature of the room
in the description, and then describe it in more detail as a Component
Object. For example:
<blockquote><code> describe here<BR><BR> <i>A description box
pops up, and I change it to "A small, dingy bathroom, dusty with
neglect. The greenish wallpaper is stained and torn, and the floor is
scuffed and marked in several places. A large, darkly colored,
unpleasant painting hangs on the wall over the shattered remains of
the toilet."</i><BR><BR> draw bob hell painting<BR><BR> string name on
bob hell painting to unpleasant painting<BR><BR> reference bob hell
painting to unpleasant painting<BR><BR> reference bob hell painting to
painting<BR><BR> describe painting <i>A dark, somber painting,
rendered in black and dark shades of green. Gangly, mishappen
creatures cavort across a hellish landscape, raising their clawed
hands to the sky where a crude capital B stands out against the
sky.</i><BR><BR> nail painting </blockquote></code> This keeps your
room descriptions from becoming too busy, and requires that the
players be thoughtful and observant when exploring your creations.
<p>
In case you were wondering, the above example makes it so that "bob hell painting" doesn't appear in the contents list of the room, but if a player types "look painting" or "look unpleasant painting", they will see it, and it will appear to be called "unpleasant painting". Being nailed also means that the players can't pick it up and walk off with it, thus ruining the effect of the room.
</blockquote>
<a name = "creating players">
<b>Creating Player Characters</b>
<blockquote>
Creating a new Player is similar to creating a Location... You will be using the sketch command, and changing it to a "Player". For example:
<blockquote><code>
sketch Bob
</blockquote></code>
Will open a window with some code in it, usually something along the lines of
<blockquote><code>
Thing<BR>
{<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp name "Bob"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp place "Bob's New Room"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp describe "A blue box."<BR>
}</blockquote></code>
And you will want to change the word "Thing" to "Player", resulting in some code akin to
<blockquote><code>
Player<BR>
{<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp name "Bob"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp place "Bob's New Room"<BR>
	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp describe "A blue box."<BR>
}</blockquote></code>
You can now click "Okay" to create your new "Bob" player. You should really call your new player something else though, because Bob is already taken.
<p>Your player isn't quite a player yet, though. They can use code and method calls that Players can, but are missing many of the common features and verbs you're probably used to using. Fortunately, you can make your player a full-fledged human being (or whatever) by extending them from class_player, a special Thing which acts as a repository for all the features and attributes that players usually have. This sounds complicated, but just type
<blockquote><code>
extend Bob from class_player
</blockquote></code>
Where Bob would be the name of your new Player. Now, you simply have to change the return value of the secondary accessible context of Bob by... No... I'm just jerking you around. Actually, you're done.
<p>
No, really. You're done. You should describe Bob, type "he Bob" or "she Bob" to make the Player male or female, respectively, instead of the neutral gender ("it") it defaults to, and
<blockquote><code>
passwd Bob to phathaxorpass
</blockquote></code>
Where Bob is your new Player and "phathaxorpass" is the password required to log in as that player. It's really not that hard. When messing around with your characters, you can refer to the characer you are currently playing as "me"... This can save you some typing.
<blockquote><i>Note: God chararacters are harder to make... You need to do a few different things to make all of the godly powers accessible to them. We don't want lots of extra god characters kicking around, but if you want to make another one for some reason, read the "</i>real<i>" author docs, and see if you can figure it out.</i>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<a name = "creating doors">
<b>Creating Doors</b><blockquote>
Now that you've made some interconnected rooms, you might be interested in making some doors. Doors are Things which govern passage through the exits you've made... They aren't exits in and of themselves, and aren't the things that allow you to move. (Moving from room to room is what exits are for.) So... Start by simply making a Thing. You can use the draw command, so just type:
<blockquote><code>
draw bob's bathroom door
</blockquote></code>
Or whatever you want your door to be called. Now... The steps used to create a door must be performed in a certain order, or your door will be messed up, as will your room, to a certain extent. The next thing you should do is describe your door, and reference it appropriately. Keep in mind that it will be visible from both of the rooms that it governs, and also remember what you called it. (And feel free to give a separate <a href="#apparent">apparent name</a> to your doors if you don't want your name plastered all over it.) Then,
<blockquote><code>
extend door from class_door
</blockquote></code>
This should cause your door to inherit all the nifty features and attributes of the class_door thing. Why? Because, if you did reference your door correctly, it should really have an alias of "door"... That's the first thing people are going to call it, unless it is clearly described as a "hatch" or something in the description. If there are other doors referenced to "door" in the room, you'll have to be more specific, though. Finally,
<blockquote><code>
<b>Make sure your Door is the way you want it to be, especially in terms of references.</b>
</blockquote></code>
This is an important point. Once you put your door in place, it will be hard to change certain things about it, especially it's aliases, and it will also exhibit certain properties in both of the connecting rooms, making it hard to change them consistantly. However, once your door is all set,
<blockquote><code>
obstruct north with door
</blockquote></code>
Where north is the direction of the exit you want to attach the door to, and door is your door. This will place the door over the exit, and make it openable and closeable. When it is closed, you can't get through, and when it's open, you can. You can also make it change the description of the room based on whether or not the door is opened or closed... You should refer to <a href="doors.html">Jedin's Door Docs</a> for the complete explaination of all the features that class_door provides.
</blockquote>
<a name = "creating clothes">
<b>Creating Clothes</b><blockquote>
Clothes are usually Things... So you can create them easily enough with the "draw" command. All you really need to do is
<blockquote><code>
draw pair of shiny golden pants
</blockquote></code>
Or whatever your new piece of clothing is called, and then figure out what type of clothing it is. There are several classes available, such as class_shirt, class_shoes, class_hat, class_pants, etc. See the <a href = "classes.html#clothing">Classes</a> page for a complete list, or rummage around in the clothing box in class_room. In this example,
<blockquote><code>
extend pair of shiny golden pants from class_pants
</blockquote></code>
Now, your clothing has "wear" and "remove" verbs, and will appear in your character's description when worn. You can change how the clothing appears while worn by giving it a "clothing appearance" string, such as
<blockquote><code>
string clothing appearance on pants to shiny golden pants
</blockquote></code>
Now if Bob wears the pants, and looks at himself, he will see "He is wearing shiny golden pants" after his description, instead of "He is wearing pair of shiny golden pants", which would just be embarassing.
<blockquote><i>Note for the reader: You can actually extend just about anything from class_clothing... Even an open/close-able container as described earlier in this text. This allows you to give your clothes pockets, and to make things like satchels or backpacks.</i></blockquote>
