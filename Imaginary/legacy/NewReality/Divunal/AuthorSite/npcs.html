<b>Divunal? What?</b>
<blockquote>
Divunal is a text based online roleplaying game. It's sort of like a
MOO, or a MUD, if you know what those are, but it was intended to be
sort of a cross between a tabletop game and a live game, played over
the internet. It's not graphical, like Ultima Online or Everquest, but
it's much faster over a slow internet connection, and because it uses
text, you can create new content quickly and easily. Due to the design
of the software, it's also nigh-impossible for the players to cheat,
which is a VERY big difference from Ultima Online.
</blockquote>
<b>Wait... No graphics? Forget it. I hate, like, letters and stuff.</b>
<blockquote>
I don't know, I think being literate is kinda cool... And as a medium, text can be a lot more flexible than graphics can. You don't need to store detailed pictures from 8 different angles of everything you want to be in the game, and you don't have to make all the players spend half an hour downloading stuff whenever you add more content to the game world. Its fast, easy, and a lot like reading a book, except that you get to be one of the characters. You do have to type a lot, but it's a good skill to practice anyway.
</blockquote>
<b>Okay... Well, what kind of game is it?</b>
<blockquote>
I was afraid you'd ask that. ;-) To put it simply, Divunal is sort of like a fantasy RPG, except that it isn't set in a traditional pseudo-european-medieval world, and includes aspects of several different fictional genres. It has a high emphasis on exploration, problem solving, and roleplaying, and while the there is a combat system, it is not the focal point of the game. Players have statistics, like they would in a tabletop game, and they can be applied in a number of ways, but the computer keeps track of all of it, and you never have to see any numbers. In fact, you can't... Your character advances both by simply being in the game, and by applying their skills and solving problems, but you never have to do any math or even read through a rulebook. Much like a live game, we strongly encourage players to remain in-character at all times, and we don't have one of those cheesy chat things where all the players can talk to each other regardless of their location.
</blockquote>
<b>If you can't see your stats, how do you create a character?</b>
<blockquote>
It's actually pretty easy... You can fill in as much basic info as you want (gender, age, etc.) and you will be presented with several randomized characters to choose from. You won't know exactly what their stats are, but you can usually get a pretty good idea of what they're good at. All the characters are numerically equal to begin with, but not all of their statistics and potential are obvious from their description. There are a lot of different classes of skills and abilities in Divunal, and each character has different aptitudes towards them.
</blockquote>
<b>How do you NPC for a video game?</b>
<blockquote>
It's actually pretty easy... You don't have to drive anywhere, you don't need to get dressed up, and you don't even have to rent an event site. The game is always running (or at least it will be when it's done) and you can show up when you want, for as long as you want. As an NPC, you can choose from a number of characters to use, or create new ones at will; The people organizing the plot will probably have things for you to do, but much like in live games, you usually have a chance to improvise. NPCs can also use the many nifty features included in our game engine to make life easier for the administrators, which allow you to keep track of players and important items, and see the statistics of various things in the game.
</blockquote>
<b>Where do all these "things in the game" come from? Is it hard to make more?</b>
<blockquote>
Our game engine was designed to be easy to use, and creating new people, places and things definitely falls into that category. The server is written entirely in Java, so even from a programming perspective, adding new features and qualities to the game is much easier than it is in other systems; You can compile and add in new features while the game is running, without inconveniencing anyone, including yourself.
<P>
In addition to NPCs, we're also looking for more Authors... People who can help add onto the worlds that the players can visit, and help to organize plots and other nifty in-game stuff. Some Authors are also Gods, in that they also play one of the Gods of Divunal, have a major influence on in-character politics and/or manage some large part of the game. But people who help out with the project don't have to fit into these roles exactly... Acting as NPCs, helping to organize in character events, and simply making more game are all helpful.
</blockquote>
<b>So what do NPCs and Authors get out of this?</b>
<blockquote>
Well, much like a certain live game, the main purpose of Divunal is to allow the people involved to have fun. However, as Divunal may become a full fledged commercial online game at some point, one obvious advantage is that NPCs, Authors, and just about anyone who contributes to the game gets free unlimited access. In fact, we'll be looking for playtesters soon... You just play the game as a player, for free, in exchange for giving us lots of feedback as to how we could make it better. We're not trying to make ourselves rich here, but we're hoping that any money we make can offset the cost of the internet bandwidth we're using... Beyond that, if any Authors or NPCs do an especially good job, we'll try to reward them.  :-)  This will probably just be in the form of Divunal T-shirts, etc., but if we do become wildly successful and rich, we'll definitely make sure the buck doesn't stop until it gets to the people who make it all possible.
</blockquote>
<b>What is the game world like? What other worlds are there? How many gods does Divnal have? Do you use reflection to allow objects to inherit properties?</b>
<blockquote>
Um... Cool, Lots, a bunch, and no, respectively... You know, you should probably just <a href="mailto:tenth@divunal.com">email us</a> if you have any more questions, and I will be also be adding onto this page in the near future. If you're interested in helping out, playtesting, or just learning more, you can email us, or request to join one of our many mailing lists.

Thanks,
