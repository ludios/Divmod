	description='Greetings, Claimant!\012\012Your grandfather left you a letter here, but it was long, and boring.\012I\'ve taken the liberty of replacing it with a condensed, more precise\012version.\012\012The salient points are:\012\012    *) Your grandfather was insane, and he babbles extensively when he\012    writes personal and business corresponances.\012\012    *) You are cursed, and doomed.  Servants of the "old ones" will be\012    here to consume your soul shortly.\012\012    *) Despite the fact that it is impossible for a mortal to overcome\012    such a fate, if you do *not* overcome it, you will be responsible\012    for the destruction of civilisation as we know it.\012\012    *) I\344!\012\012    *) Scattered throughout the mansion in no particular order are\012    clues to your grandfather\'s insanity, his descent into the\012    netherworld, and your possible salvation.  No detail was, or will\012    be given on what these clues are, and you\'re lucky if you can find\012    them.\012\012Please feel free to contact us if you have requests for any further\012advice!  (That is, if you manage to figure out how to fix your\012sabotaged car and repair the cut phone lines.)\012\012                                       -- Nasty, Brutish, and Short\012                                          Attorneys at Law',
