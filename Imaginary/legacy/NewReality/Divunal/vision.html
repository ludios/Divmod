<h1>Divunal 2002 - It's Cold. It's Dark. Forever.</h1>
<h2>Kenaan's Back, and He's Mad</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/pokey233_1.gif" /></div>

<p> This is an attempt to commit to paper the stuff that I've been repeating
over and over and over again every time I talk about the <q>New Divunal</q>
with someone over the phone.  It will probably be incomplete.  For brevity, I
am going to assume you know a little about what the old Divunal was, what
Twisted is, and a little bit about the previous implementation (TR/J, and the
infamous tr2.tar.gz.)  If any references to these various arcana are confusing
to you, you probably want to ask one of: <ul>
  <li>glyph</li>
  <li>dash</li>
  <li>tenth</li>
</ul>
Sadly, that's probably all the people who remember it at this point :-(
</p>

<p>On with the story.</p>

<h2>Problems That Lead Me to This Point</h2>

<p>The old Divunal had many problems.
<ol>
  <li>The core gameplay (renewable activity) was rather difficult to
  express.</li>
  
  <li>The game world was centered around a group of characters created by the
  authors, not the players.</li>

  <li>Much of the multiplayer content was not actually multiplayer; it was an
  environment multiple people could have joined and observed, but only one
  could really be playing at once.</li>

  <li>The game was supposed to be based on a consistent feel, and although it
  was better than most MUDs, there was a huge variation between different
  authors' areas and there was nothing that tied them all together.</li>

  <li>Automatic generation of environments was poorly specified and was never
  implemented.</li>

  <li>Authoring new areas required knowledge (probably expert-level intimate
  knowledge) of the game's, <em>and the infrastructure's</em>
  implementation. </li>

  <li>Everything was closely tied to a 3-panes-of-text interface; no abstract
  world model.</li>

  <li>The parser sucked.  Oh god, how the parser sucked.  This may seem minor,
  but in a game that was entirely based around text, it was fundamental. </li>

  <li>We spent so much time on infrastructure that the game never got written.
  (You could view this as a good thing.  We wouldn't have twisted if not for my
  annoying habit of getting distracted by shiny new ideas.  Python is sooo
  shiny.)</li>
  
  <li>Many of the assumptions about the infrastructure, in terms of things like
  method dispatch and remote authoring, were wrong, and although the people
  arguing with us were in general <strong>more</strong> wrong, we (okay, maybe
  <q>I</q> would be more appropriate...) were to improve upon very naive
  techniques that we discovered early on in the project.</li>

  <li>Unique objects made many things difficult.  Among them, storage
  management and user interface.  User interface was a problem because every
  author had to come up with a <strong>globally</strong> unique identifier with
  no indications of what was unique or display of information regarding
  uniqueness.  The extreme dynamicism expected of the system made it completely
  insane to design a good back-end for it.  ZODB might have worked but it is
  unlikely.</li>

  <li>Much of the documentation had to concern itself with work-arounds and
  technical errata, making it harder to read than it should have been.  This
  was a really noticeable symptom of the implementation-focused vision behind
  the project.</li>
  
  <li>The central problem: <strong>It was not humanly possible for even the
  largest supportable team of authors to generate content fast enough that even
  the smallest supportable player base would always have something to
  do.</strong>
  </li>


</ol>

But it wasn't all bad.

<ol>
  
  <li>It was targeted at a literate audience, which allowed for more
  experimental approaches to the art of game making.</li>

  <li>Much of the world that was made was just fucking cool, if I do say so
  myself.</li>

  <li>Talking about and working on the game was fun, which was a good
  indication that people playing it would have fun, too (if we could ever
  straighten out what "playing it" meant, anyway.</li>

  <li>The characters of the gods, while too central, had some interesting
  motifs associated with them, particularly the notion of archetypes which are
  NOT the major arcana, which represent values relevant to the modern
  man. (this should have been taken further!)
  </li>

  <li>The story around those gods was also interesting.  I found the most
  interesting bits the shadowy corners of their pasts that were left
  only implied, and we sometimes contemplated. (More on this later.)</li>

  <li>The notion of 'memory' and 'psyche' as central game elements was NEAT!
  It was close to the beginnings of a totally non-violent game system.</li>

  <li>Archaeology was also cool.</li>

  <li>And dreaming.  Did I mention dreaming?  The notion of a dream sequence
  where you would not 'awaken' into the game gave players something to do every
  day that set their emotional context for the play-session.  Again, really
  revolutionary concept. </li>
  
  <li>Character description elements were the most advanced I've ever seen, in
  ANY game, text or graphics... and we had only just begun prototyping them at
  the end of the project.</li>

  <li>We had <strong>terrific docs</strong>.  Despite my previous complaint
  about them, they were fun to read, very interesting, informative,
  comprehensive, and current.  Even given the cruddy state of the technology,
  it was possible to get into the code by reading the docs carefully.
  <div align="center"><img src="http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/pokey52_4.gif"
></div>
  
  I've said it before, and I'll say it again; tenth was the only reason we had
  those docs.  He did some terrific work on that project, and if you've gotten
  the mails from reality-list about them, you should go read them.  I think
  they're a pretty good example of how to write documentation that people will
  actually read.  I hope to give him a chance to write docs for tech that isn't
  quite so bad.
  
  </li>

  <li>We spent a lot more time focusing on mood and environment than on story
  (or even gameplay).  This was, all in all, a good thing because it allowed us
  to have a feel to the world.  This is very important in online worlds,
  because it's not just an activity the player engages in, it's also a place
  for them to go. </li>
  
</ol>
</p>

<p>So there are things that I want to keep about the old style of the game, but
keeping it wholesale would be far too hard.</p>

<p>This list, combined with my experiences at Origin and Ninjaneering, (and a
form of fusion) allowed me to make the following observations about how the
game ought to work: </p>

<ol>

  <li>The renewable activity needs to be the first and most central thing that
  gets thought about.  This is more important than the story, more important
  than the world, more important even than the theme (although marginally) --
  it is the heart of the game, and without it, players won't play.  </li>

  <li><strong>Players like numbers that go up.</strong> <div
  align="center"><img src="http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/pokey90_7.gif"
  ></div>
  
  We need to give them a number that will go up.  Even <q>real role-players</q>
like numbers that go up; they want to know the most efficient manner to advance
so they can focus on role-playing.
  They like mechanisms in place to limit the audacity of new power-gamer
  upstarts, and power to smash trash-talking old hands.</li>

  <li>Death is not something that the player should experience first hand.  It
  is just a lose-lose proposition, both in terms of retention and overall fun
  value.  </li>
  
  <li>However, I strongly believe that this does not mean that
  death should be swept under the rug and not treated seriously; that just
  means that within the narrative of the game world, players
  should not be able to die.  That is not dead which can get up and walk around
  again and fuck with your shit immediately after you've ganked it, or
  something.
  </li>

  <li>Now for the deep crack.  <strong>Having a bible in a
  game world is a terrible idea, and the story you tell will only serve to piss
  the players off.</strong> I bet you thought that was the crack, huh?  Nope.
  </li>

  <li>THIS is the crack.  <strong>Divunal should have no story at all, and make
  everything up as you go along, establishing the mechanics and explaining them
  retroactively.</strong> Especially, we should pay attention to player
  commentary on what things in the game world might mean.  This harnesses the
  vast creativity and perverse patience of the player base to our advantage;
  also, we never have to retconn, because nothing's ever been explained.  I
  will expand on this more later, because I think it says something really deep
  about MMP worlds.</li>
  
</ol>

<p>While I still, sadly, have not had the experience of working on a shipped
game, I've learned a lot from the game designers and programmers in the game
industry that I worked with, about what to do and what not to do.  They have
some keen insights; they have a lot of experience.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/pokey350_4.gif"
/></div>

<p>They also continue to make some very dumb decisions.  This is for two
central reasons.  One, they have had some really horrible experiences which
could be blamed on any number of things that went wrong, which they didn't
really learn from. (designers blame it on the programmers (programmers blame it
on the artists (artists blame it on the programmers (who shift the reciprocal
blame around to the designers (do the hokey pokey, etc))))).  Two, they are
swayed by perceived economic forces which encourage the production of pure
tripe.  I will probably have to remove this paragraph later, as more people
join in, but at least I can be frank with this small initial group.  The game
industry is pretentious about their understanding of business and money, and
has let art fall by the wayside, which is what they're really <em>good</em> at.
We can't follow all of their examples otherwise we'll just end up making the
same regurgitated D&amp;D that Verant and Origin are pumping out, which is
really just doubly-regurgitated Tolkien.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Divunal doesn't have to face the full burden of correcting all
these mistakes.  The <a href="http://netsu.org/" >Netsu</a> project will be
addressing many of them beforehand.  As I plan for Divunal to be a multi-year
project culminating sometime after the release of a few other games on this
platform, I'm taking a long view of things.  Most of what you read in this
document will probably have been changed or at least improved in some way by
the time it's done, not to mention TONS of other stuff being added.</p>

<p>So if I'm not doing an immediate, <q>hack the world</q> project with Divunal
this time, determined to make a living for myself, make a bold artistic
statement, and change the game industry at once, what is it?  It's a launching
point to that goal.  I'm sure that if you're reading this document you have
some interest in online virtual worlds, and probably in asbahr.com.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/pokey172_3.gif"
/></div>


<p>Divunal will be our <q>place with a memory</q> (apologies to Allen Short),
the virtual world that Twisted hackers actually work and live in.  Hopefully it
will also be a publicly accessible game for the open source community before
it's officially <q>launched</q>.</p>

<h2>Solving the Problem of Infrastructure: Using What I've Learned</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/pokey23_3.gif"
/></div>

<p>Obviously one part of the infrastructure solution for Divunal is Twisted.
Another major component of the solution is Beyond, which we have begun
implementing a spike of in the Reality source tree.</p>

<p>This is a continuation (and combination) of the research into game design
that Jason Asbahr and I have been doing for the last ... 5 years each, I guess?
It's quite comprehensive, especially because we have both had mobility between
games and worlds into account, something that most game infrastructure
designers either pay lip service to or vocally ignore.</p>

<p>A lot of what's here is unsurprising.  It's been in progress for quite some
time, after all, and almost all of you reading this doc have likely come into
contact with me due to the Twisted project.  We're going to use Python for
scripting.  We're going to make heavy use of reflection.  I plan to have very
dynamic game behavior.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/pokey81_3.gif"
/></div>

<p>There are some new things, though; most notably, I consider the problem of
infrastructure wholly separate from the problem of game design, and I think
that it's feasible to support this.  The biggest reason it's feasible to support is that we've spent 2 years developing infrastructure first ;-)</p>

<p> One of the biggest structural changes to the code is that everything is
broken into lots of little pieces, and the code is centered around designing
game <em>systems</em> rather than game <em>objects</em>.  The idea being that
you code classes which specify an object's behavior in a particular context,
not its entire state; a sword might also be a magic wand, but except in special
circumstances, the spellcasting bits don't care about the sword-wielding bits;
the code for them can be separate and still be applied to the same object
(without creating a new class and figuring out the nightmares that result from
multiple inheritance!). </p>

<p>So rather than writing a SwordOfSmiting class and a SwordOfKilling class and
a SwordOfNoSeriouslyYouAreSoDead class, you can just write IAttackTool
interface and a DefaultAttackTool class, which can have some data plugged into
it that satisfies most of the various kinds of sword one can have, with special
subclasses for very unusual behavior.  In fact, the "sword" behavior of a
physical object in the world can be a separate Python object from the actual
physical object, enabling us to do cool things like temporarily imbue a Sword
of Smiting with the attack properties of a Sword of OMFG You are *Toast*, in a
very well-defined way.</p>

<p>Focusing on game systems instead of game objects is the real thrust of the
architectural tsunami currently going through the Reality code.  By the time
it's done, I think that the game code will be <em>significantly</em> easier to
read, especially with regard to questions like <q>what happens when I hit
somebody with a sword? how can I change that?</q>. </p>

<p>So what are we going to do with all this infrastructure?  Nothing.  A very
<em>special</em> kind of nothing, though.</p>

<h2>The Zero Story</h2>

<h3>Where Divunal Mk. 2 got started</h3>

<p>Okay, this is the good part, kids.
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://yellow5.com/pokey/archive/pokey203_2.gif" ></div>

<p>With the re-design of Divunal, I really wanted to focus on that feel that we
got from the eerie and weird parts of the world, and emphasize it.  The
inspiration that I drew on was the endlessly amusing conversations I would have
with people speculating about the real meaning behind really obscure games.
The first such conversation I can remember that really impressed me was when
Tenth and I were talking about Silent Hill, and he brought up the fellow who
claimed he had gotten in an ambulance and hot-wired it and driven all over the
town with a nuclear torpedo launcher strapped to his roof or something.  It was
intriguing to debate the true meaning of the game, perhaps more interesting
than playing the game itself.</p>

<p>One of the last of these, which (in a roundabout fashion) got me started on
this design path was a conversation I had with Allen about Deus Ex.  The men in
black, at various points throughout the game, say spooky things that hint at
their cruel and distorting training.  These were once human, but it is clear
that they are no longer, from the pale hue of their skin to the faint echo in
their voice.  The particular line that got me thinking was:</p>

<blockquote>
Cold.  Cold and dark.  It goes on forever.
</blockquote>

<p>This simple statement is beautiful.  It's incredibly vague.  It's a topic
for hours of conversation.  Better yet, I doubt the game designers themselves
knew what they were talking about when they put it in; it just sounded creepy.
(I haven't checked with Ion Storm yet; I'll let you know if I found out.)  Our
initial discussion, of course, was about what the MiBs could mean by this
statement, based on scraps and clues we'd found throughout the game about the
history of the MiBs.  </p>

<p>Then I started thinking about it in a more general sense: what would be a
cold darkness that really went on <em>forever</em> be like? Where would it be?
What would it be doing there? Would the sheer weight of its infinity cause it
to be sentient?</p>

<p>And I realized that these questions were probably better for a game than any
of the answers that I could come up with to solve them.
</p>

<h3>Why Zero Story is Better: Who Are We Trying to Kid, Here?</h3>

<p>The tradition of <q>design the world first, then write the history, then
write the story</q> is in the venerable tradition Tolkien and the numerous
Tolkien-imitators that followed.  For many it has worked excellently.  For most
computer games, it has, in my humble but correct opinion, been a dismal
failure.  I suppose you could disagree with this, but like, if you thought the
plot to <q>Anarchy Online</q> or <q>EverQuest</q> or <q>Dark Cloud</q> or
<q>Ultima Online</q> or <q>Shadow Hearts</q> was a gripping and dramatic tale
with keen insights into the human condition, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn for
you at very reasonable rates.  </p>

<p>Online games suffer especially badly.  For some unknown reason, possibly
conceit, the designers believe that the players will care about the plot.  Some
designers eventually come to realize that nobody cares.  Strangely, most who do
take away from that the notion that players don't care about <em>any kind of
narrative whatsoever</em>, because they don't want to walk around a bunch of
fixed points on the terrain, collecting plot coupons at half-hour intervals in
order to read some half-assed backstory that was written by four different
interns who were only allowed to communicate with tin cans and a string. </p>

<p>Obviously I am somewhat overstating the case here, but the problems are
real.  There are three issues at the heart of this:

<ul>
  <li>Most designers are not J.R.R. Tolkien, since they design games and don't
  write stories, and</li>
  
  <li>even if they were, Tolkien spent the better part of FOUR YEARS writing
  <em>just</em> the backstory to his NOVELS which he only had to interest a
  reader in for at most THREE DAYS (not the better part of their adult lives),
  but even if those were the constraints designers had to work with, </li>

  <li>they are working with large teams of people, all of whom want to have
  creative input.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>Who are we kidding here, really?  Working under the same sort of rules that
Tolkein did doesn't make any sense.  Our medium is vastly different.</p>

<h3>The Rules for Zero Story</h3>

<p>There are a few rules I'd like to outline for the beginning of this
experiment in cutting-edge design techniques:

<ul>
  <li>Keep a list of all the phenomena that can occur in the world,
  so that we have some sense of what we can't contradict in the fiction.</li>
  
  <li>Keep a list of readable plot material that all authors have
  put into the world, and the context in which it is available so we can work
  out the plausibility of its being false.</li>

  <li>Keep a close eye on what the players are saying about the
  world, and talking about any cool ideas.</li>

  <li>Have a hierarchical autocracy with regard to mechanics, whereby a
  particular creative decision may be made by someone responsible for an
  area, but overridden by the one managing the mechanics above that. (This I am
  the least sure about; we will need to experiment.) </li>

  <li>Add content over time, both to the story and the mechanics.
  Introductions to the mechanics should be done as artifacts, and only very
  rarely new intrinsic characteristics of the players.</li>

</ul>

Now that I've outlined that, this document will serve as the initial
repositories.  This will have to be broken out eventually, but here's the brain
dump of what I've got so far.</p>

<h3>Mood and Metaphysics</h3>

<p class="narrator">You start the game in the dark.</p>

<p class="narrator">It's dark, it's cold, you hear noises.</p>

<p class="narrator">Eventually the noises subside and you can see a point of
light coming towards you.  It's a table illuminated by a spotlight, and on the
table there are various implements.</p>

<p>This will be repeated several times - it is the game tutorial.  The
implements on the table will be a knife and a worm, for example, or a lock and
a key.  The table will slide away as soon as you've finished doing whatever's
supposed to be done with them.  This should be a complete enough set of
interactions to get you through your first ten or twenty hours of gameplay.</p>

<p>Interesting note here: no <q>guess-the-verb</q> style puzzles.  Most, if not
all, of the verbs required for routine play are found in this initial,
half-hour-or-less tutorial.  For those which aren't there, there should be help
functionality, which describes all the possible actions that an object can
play.</p>

<p>Puzzle solving should be at more of a macro level, since it's all about
conserving time to gain things.  Players will need to be doing similar tasks in
ways that seem novel to them, but using mechanics they understand.</p>

<p class="narrator">As the final table slides from view, you find yourself in
the darkness again, alone.</p>
<p class="player">go north</p>
<p class="narrator">You stumble around in the dark for a moment.</p>
<p class="player">look</p>

<p class="narrator"><strong>[ Complete Darkness ]</strong> You are standing in
the middle of a completely dark plain, which, as far as you can tell, is
perfectly flat.  Wait - not complete darkness.  Off in the far distance to the
north, you can see a faint haze of light spilling out of a doorway. </p>
<p class="player">go north</p>
<p class="narrator">
You walk until you reach the light.  You seem to get there quite a bit faster
than you were walking...<br/>

<strong>[ Entrance to the Library ]</strong> You are at the foot of a white
stone staircase, at the top of which is an enormous, open pair of double doors.
This place gives you a strong impression of being a boundary.  To the south,
there is nothing but an infinite abyss of blackness, from which you feel a
faint chill.  To the north, up a white stone staircase and through the doors,
there is light, a little warmth. </p>

<p class="player">go north</p>

<p class="narrator"><strong>[ Just Inside the Library ]</strong> You are at one
entrance to a grand library.  A bright light suffuses the room, though there is
no glare, as the whole ceiling is glowing evenly, brightly, and softly.  To
your south, there are a pair of double doors that open onto pure blackness.  To
your north, you can look out over rows and rows of shelves, all stocked with
various books.  Far to the north, you can see a wall punctuated at intervals
with various doors; some of them look like elevators.
</p>

<p class="narrator">You notice can see yourself clearly for the first time.
</p>

<p>A few notes about this environment.  One; the hallway is infinite, and it
loops -- walking east or west from here will loop after you do it some number
of times.  As new players join the game, new 'door' rooms will be added,
increasing the effective length of this hallway.</p>

<p>The doors in the back lead to various places in the library.  You can go
everywhere from here -- literally.  There are warp gates that you can activate,
linking books that you can read, and odd passageways in the library itself that
end up in curious places.</p>

<p>There are really far too many of these to cover here.  I'll talk about a few
more in the "environments" section.</p>

<p class="player">look at me</p>

<p class="narrator">You are completely featureless!  You are wearing a white
long-sleeved shirt, loose-fitting white slacks, and white shoes.  Your skin is
completely white.  The one distinguishing feature is a mark on the palm of your
left hand. </p>

<p>All players start as identical clones of a completely featureless albino.
Though you can't see it without a mirror; you have completely white eyes (no
pupils) no hair.  The character customization system is built around artifacts
found in-game.  (When you grow hair initially it will, unsurprisingly, be
white.)</p>

<p>This is really the central mystery of the game.  All the players emerge from
the dark, hairless, genderless automata with very unusual tolerances to the
elements.  When they die, they return to the darkness (mechanics of death
later).  </p>

<p class="player">look mark</p>

<p class="narrator">The mark appears to be a bar-code of some kind, with three
numbers below it: 000 000 999 </p>

<p>These three numbers are the core statistics that make up the game.  Most
other numbers that affect your character won't be visible, at least initially.
These three numbers are, respectively, CHARGE, SCORE, and HEALTH, which we will
abbreviate, for historical reasons, to ZAP, WIN, and HP.  (Just kidding.)  They
will be discussed below in the section on mechanics.</p>

<p>The next stage of the player's introduction will come from a genderless,
emotionless voice giving them instructions, instructing them to one of the
doors set into the back wall.  They have to enter an apartment key-code which
allows them access to their living quarters.  There is a strong implication
that these living quarters are not physically connected to the library by any
meaningful tether, and the elevators are not just going up and down.  One of
the indications is that although the elevator takes about 15 seconds for a
player to get from one room to another, it only takes about 1 second for the
next elevator to be available from outside.</p>

<p>Players curious enough to explore before going upstairs will note that the
books on the shelves are actually full-text copies of Gutenberg Project books,
complete with turning pages.  If they do this now (rather than after visiting
their apartment), they will be treated to a brief explanation of how to borrow
books from the library.  You can borrow any book, and do anything you like with
it, for 7 days, provided you don't damage it.  If you do damage it, or you fail
to return it... well, someone will get upset, and make sure to take the book
from you, as well as whatever you're carrying at the time.  This is an effect
more or less like Paradox from Mage: The Ascension.  Lots of different kinds of
horrible things can happen to you, but it always happens, and they always get
the book back.  (The more bad-ass you are at the time, the worse whatever it is
that's sent after you is.)</p>

<h4>Core Mechanics</h4>

<h5>Acquiring Charge</h5>

<p>You can acquire charge through various mechanisms.</p>

<p>There are various low-output sparkly faucets that you can use in the
library, which will drop a certain amount of charge in a day; if you can find
one, you can get its charge for the day.  Think TRON, but really small
pools.</p>

<p>There are one-use items throughout the world that give you far greater
amounts of charge than those faucets (2x-4x as much, on average).  A sample of
one of these would be a <q>charge card</q>; a white plastic card about the size
of a pack of cigarettes, but about 1/8 the depth.  When the player cracks it in
half, it sparks brightly, smokes and vanishes, and their charge goes up.</p>

<p>As the game progresses you will find more and more ways that you can get
electricity.  You will find generators, but none of them have a steady supply
of fuel; if you find a diesel engine, for example, it can power you up
significantly, but you have to find fuel and transport it there and not have it
evaporate or explode and kill you.  All interesting potential challenges for a
player.</p>

<p>Batteries can hold charge -- you can spend it to charge up a battery.  There
is a slight loss in charge each time you do this, between 0.5 and 0.95,
depending on the quality of the battery.  Retrieving the charge from the
batteries is not lossy.</p>

<p>When you acquire charge, your score goes up by double the charge you have
acquired.</p>

<p>There will only ever be 3 numbers on your hand.  They start out in base 10.  As you acquire more and more charge, the numbers will shift base, and a smaller number will appear describing what base they're in.   </p>

<h5>Spending Charge</h5>

<p>Pretty much anything worth doing will either require spending charge, or an
object that you had to spend charge to get.  (This can be indirected a ridiculous
number of times, to the point where it's very hard to tell that charge is even
important, but it is the root of the resource tree.)  Spending charge is not
really a willful act on the part of the player.  They can 'activate' a device,
or 'touch' a contact, and they will spend an appropriate amount of electricity.
Various spell-like effects later in the game will allow spending it more
directly; 'cast frotz' will have the player mumble something, produce a brief
smell of ozone, and their charge will go down.</p>

<p>Each time a player spends charge, either to put it into storage, convert its
format, or to activate a device directly, they lose the same number of score
points as the charge they've spent.</p>

<p>Some things cost a certain fixed amount of charge to do, others cost a
variable random amount constrained within a range.  With mechanical devices,
you always run the risk of having them <q>short out</q> and cost you far more
charge than they're worth, or damage you.</p>

<h5>Character Customization</h5>

<p>One of the things that you can get by spending charge is character
customizations.  This is not nearly completely thought out yet, but the basic
plan so far is that there will be a listing of color and style categories
ordered by cost.  Each tier costs about an order of magnitude more than the
last; there are enough of these that the top tier is ridiculously expensive.
Colors can be applied to: skin, eyes (the 'whites' of the eyes are actually
colored; the players have no pupils or irises), hair, shirt, pants, and shoes.
The garments a player is wearing are part of them, to some extent; for the time
being (until we start discussing implications of the <q>adult</q> version of
this) we'll assume that they can never remove them.  Artifacts found throughout
the world can change the styling of the clothes, the length of their hair, and
these colors.  All these artifacts require charge.  Most are fairly easy to
find.</p>

<p>Dying has an adverse effect on all these elements.  Every character
customization is decreased in intensity by one point, and each customization
has ten points of intensity.  For example, if you got yourself very long black
hair, and then got yourself killed, you'd find yourself with long very dark
gray hair.</p>

<p>I also plan to allow players to add to their <q>living</q> space; these
additions will not be affected by death or defeat.  They will also be
considerably more expensive.  One of the cheaper additions to living space will
be extensions; additional storage blocs where you can keep stuff.</p>

<h5>Losing Charge (also known as <q>Death</q>)</h5>

<p>This isn't fully thought through yet, but players will take damage as normal
for other games.  One caveat; think mega-damage, not regular damage scales.  A
MAC truck smashing into them at 80 or 90 miles per hour is about the smallest
amount of damage that's really going to get their attention.  They are
especially impervious to temperatures; a Divunal character could go swimming in
liquid nitrogen and it would only feel a little chilly.  Given that they're so
tough, health is a fairly difficult thing to get back; healing artifacts won't
be found until the player has a score of a couple thousand.</p>

<p>Dying is when health reaches -100.  When a player reaches 0 health,
they start to appear more and more translucent, and start slowly losing health
over time (1 pt / 30 seconds -- goal of this number is to make it so the player
can run away and/or hide their stuff before knocking off, but not making people
wait too long before they die).  As they get close to 0 (-25 or so) the
translucency fades, and they become chalky and blue in splotches.  At 0, they
become pure cobalt blue and shatter, and continue shattering, until only a
very, very fine blue dust is left behind, so fine it looks like smoke.  This
dust settles and sublimates in a few seconds.  Okay, we can say
<q>evaporates</q> if players don't know what sublimation is ^_^. </p>

<p>When a player <q>dies</q>, he is returned to the outer darkness from which
he came.  The above changes described to their customizations happen, but they
should rarely (if ever!) lose a significant amount of stuff.  In this game, you
are your stuff.  Also, corpse retrieval is a <em>terrible</em> idea.</p>

<p>One of the most common items -- perhaps even available automatically in your
apartment -- will be a backpack that will automatically teleport to your
apartment when you disappear.  Players will have a limited inventory and so
will keep most things in this container.  Whatever they've left outside of it
will have to be retrieved, but given the somewhat lax limits on stash, this
should not be a major problem.  (These items also won't disappear unless
another player picks them up.  There may be some way to tag an item for
ownership.)</p>

<p>There is a penalty, however.  Any charge that the player has acquired at the
time is lost, and double the amount of score is lost for that charge.</p>

<p>The Darkness itself has a score, and any time somebody engages in PvP combat
and <q>dies</q>, the Darkness's score goes up by an amount equal to that of the
player's lost charge.  As-yet-indeterminate Bad Things will happen if the
Darkness's score goes up to certain levels.</p>

<h5>Translocation</h5>

<p>Most of the actual gameplay is not within the walls of the library itself.
The library provides access to lots of different worlds, through different
mechanisms.  The three I'm currently planning on are:

<ol>
  <li>Warp Gates</li>
  <li>Linking Books</li>
  <li>Obscure Passages</li>
</ol>

Warp gates require charge to activate, and are by far the most common way out.
Linking books are going to be the way that player-generated worlds get linked
into the game; they don't require charge to activate, but then, usually you
won't be able to affect your charge or score in one of those worlds (and
sometimes your avatar there may be significantly different than the one in
Divunal). </p>

<p>Obscure passages will be difficult to find, but they will not cost anything
to travel through.  These are like the ways you would get to things in the
original Divunal; you'll be walking down a hallway, it will begin slanting
downwards, and you'll find yourself knee deep in water, books floating around
you.  Or, you'll be in an art gallery, and every few hours, when the sun is
shining through a window at a particular angle, one of the paintings isn't a
painting, it's an open window.</p>

<p>Also, obscure passages will typically lead to very difficult, high-level
areas.  These areas will have a high risk/reward ratio.</p>

<p>(TODO: better description of what a warp gate looks and behaves like)</p>

<h3>Gameplay Design Guide</h3>

<p>Divunal is a game about archaeology.  The satisfied Divunal player will
basically be gorging themselves on the sort of schizophrenic kleptomania that
all adventure games have, taken to its logical conclusion.  The world belongs
to you and you are trying to pick it all up.</p>

<p>This means; if it isn't nailed down, you pick it up.  If it <em>is</em>
nailed down, you pick it up.  If it's buried, you dig it up.  If it's buried
under six feet of reinforced concrete and guarded by a legion of crack
marines... well, you become an expert in explosives and tactical combat, then
you pick it up.  When you've gotten whatever it is, you put it in your bag and
take it back to your apartment, where you squirrel it away until you figure out
what it's good for.</p>

<p>Most of the constructed gameplay (quests) in Divunal will revolve around
finding particular items and combining them with each other.  The player will
have to engage in some combination of adventuring, archaeology, sociology,
burglary and robbery in order to accomplish this.  The game should be balanced
in favor of <q>good</q> players who get stuff either from the environment or
from willing, voluntary other players or NPCs.  While brief spates of rapid
advancement may be possible with violence, that should often come back to haunt
you.</p>

<p>Self-defense, however, is a necessary part of tomb robbing.  Being light and
nimble -- collecting all the treasure before the nasties figure out where you
are and come after you -- will be an advantage, but eventually you're going to
need parties of 3 or more Divunal players to go to an area and have 2 or more
fend off the bad guys while one extracts the treasure. </p>

<h3>Features of the World</h3>

<h4>Emotional Factors</h4>

<p>Since characters don't experience death directly, there needs to be
something in the world to motivate them to care about victory and defeat.  This
is perhaps the most obvious answer, but it's rarely implemented; the whole
world is a hostage situation.  Players won't experience death directly (who
ever does?), but they will experience death by proxy; the things they care
about can be destroyed.</p>

<p>In most games, sympathetic characters are disposable.  They are <q>pets</q>,
which has come to mean (in game industry parlance) nethack-style pets.  These
characters, while sympathetic, are better to sacrifice than to protect, since
you can always get another pet, but you can't always get another <em>you</em>.
The sympathetic characters in Divunal, most often, won't join you in combat,
since they are mortal and you aren't.</p>

<p>In collecting your various bits of detritus around the world, you'll often
have to gain the trust of a group of semi-intelligent NPCs.  No characters in
Divunal should be expected to speak English intelligently, with the exception
of shopkeepers in some of the more advanced worlds (and they will have a fairly
limited vocabulary and probably won't be so sympathetic).  These could range
from small, tribble-like <q>fuzzies</q> to honor-bound, warlike orcs.</p>

<p>While some quests will require a single item to be retrieved from a group of
potentially friendly creatures, a player can also acquire a <q>herd</q>, e.g. a
group of friendly creatures that create disposable charge-producing or
converting items for them.  Damage to that herd (whether from other players or
environmental factors) will reduce their income.  The friendlies that a
particular player becomes the protector of will likely be based on their
personality, and conflicts between groups of potential friendlies may cause
opposed players to come into conflict.</p>

<p>Some friendlies will be amorphous faces in the crowd; some will be unique
characters that interact with the player and learn from them.  The former will
be a lot more common from the latter, and over time the latter should really
start to stand out. </p>

<p>The image that I want you to get in reading this is a player sitting on a
rock, playing with a group of cheerful, cute-looking fuzzy creatures, sort of
like Teddy-bears, making warbling and squeaking noises.  Another character,
more sinister looking, appears from thin air with a *bamf*, and starts talking
trash to the first player.  The fuzzies huddle behind the first player, and
some start running away.  To make a point, the second player zaps the first;
the first doesn't like that, but tries to talk him down.  The second player's
clearly a griefer and doesn't want to hear about calming down; so he ups the
ante by zapping one of the uniquely colored fuzzies.  That pisses the first
player off.  He shoos the fuzzies away from behind him, exhorting them to run
away, and then turns to square off with the second player.</p>

<p>Optionally, the first player calls their defense network on a
cell-phone-like device, bringing the hurt down on player 2 even worse.  The
defender should have a sizeable advantage in situations like this; an
unsuccessful raid is no reason for someone to stop playing, but getting your
carefully-cultivated village of friendlies wiped out might be.  The attackers
should want to be discreet, quiet, and cause as little damage as possible;
griefers will end up doing things that are visibly unpleasant to the world, and
it should come around to hurt them as much as it hurt their victims.  </p>

<h3>Creator Character Archetypes</h3>

<p>The archetype characters in Divunal Mk.1 were interesting, but too limited.
In this iteration, I'd like the archetypes to be separate from their specific
instances; we should be able to have multiple author characters playing into a
particular archetype.  While archetypes and their instances can figure into the
storyline (and even metaphysics) prominently, there should always be some
indication that they are slightly less cool, less currently relevant, or at
least less powerful, than player characters.  </p>

<p>The two archetypes that I'd really like to take from Divunal 1 are the
Chronicler and the Artificer.</p>

<h4>The Artificer</h4>

<p>This is definitely the archetype that I want to devote the most initial
treatment to; perhaps even the prime archetype.  It was represented in Divunal
1 by the character of Tenth.  Given the mechanically oriented nature of the
players' avatars, the artificer archetype figures prominently somehow into the
"beginning of the end", the creation of the library and perhaps even the void.
</p>

<p>The existing Tenth character, along with his brass menagerie and improbable
household, is a good example of what the first instance of this archetype
should be like.  I will refrain from commenting too much on what he should be
like until Dave Sturgis gets a pass at either editing this document or writing
up his own character description/motivation.</p>

<p>The Artificer builds things.  He creates art.  He builds them to any end;
mostly because they must be built.  He is the technologist and engineer.
Development, not research.</p>

<p>Again, Tenth is a good example here, because the Artificer has two sides,
much as technology does.  He builds interesting things, he builds toys, but he
also builds weapons.  He is liberating mankind with his works, but also a slave
to his creations.</p>

<h4>The Chronicler</h4>

<p>This was a part of Maxwell's poorly-defined and sprawling archetype ;-).
Maxwell had a lot of things going on though, not the least of which was a god
complex on my part, so I don't know if he'd make a good initial pass at this
archetype.  Definitely I'd like to see him brought in at some point, refined a
little, but Roland (IIRC Benjamin <q>Bento</q> Moore's initial Divunal
character, the archivist) might be a better frame of reference. </p>

<p>The Chronicler records things and learns things.  He is a teacher and a
historian, not an actor.  He tries to apply the mistakes of the past to lessons
of the present, and the lessons of the present to the future.  His mantra is
<q>those who do not understand the past are doomed to repeat it</q>.  If you
don't know enough about this kind of person, look at Usenet political
discussions for mentions of Hitler and Bosnia.  It will become readily
apparent.  </p>

<p>This archetype explains the character's purpose in the game, although not
their origins.  They are to search out artifacts and try to understand their
past.</p>

<h4>Others</h4>

<p>There are a couple of other ideas for archetypes knocking around in my head,
but I'm not sufficiently certain of them yet.  The Mediator would be a useful
one to have around, which would be the distillation of OPN's definition of a
catalyst.  The Explorer/Adventurer (Jedin) would be a good foil to the
Chronicler; it's what the players are actually doing, not what's being done for
them.  There are others, such as the Honest Merchant and the Good Samaritan
that I'm not sure how to express as succinctly.  </p>

<p>Frameworks that describe the archetypes should therefore be open-ended.
There should be no temples with X pillars lining the edge, for example, that
are supposed to describe them all.  There may be civilizations that worship
only 3 or 4 of them, in some configuration, but never more than that. </p>

<p>The implication that there were <em>original</em> versions of these
archetypes, and that they are representations of actual people who existed at
some point, might be raised repeatedly but should never, ever be confirmed.
</p>

<h3>Worlds</h3>

<h4>Common Themes</h4>

<p>Entropy is winning right now, but not fatally.  The players have ways to
reverse that trend locally, perhaps even start a more fundamental reversal.  In
every world, something really big has been ruined in some way, and it's up to
the players to fix it, or to start anew.</p>

<h4>Stone: A Beginner's World</h4>

<p>Stone is a world which the player can gate to very close to entering the
game.  The initial impression upon entering it is that it is an idyllic,
pastoral place, a green world with lots of grass and trees.  In times that are
<em>far</em> lost to the mist of unwritten history, there were castles here,
that looked like they were built for slightly larger-than-average humanoids.
Most of these are rubble now.  In fact, they're sufficiently demolished that
they may be mistaken for natural rock formations initially.</p>

<p>There are still underground areas that show that a very high tech level
civilization was here at one point.  These are modeled after the castle
greysen's West Wing, the Cloud Balcony et. al. from the original Divunal.  The
entrances to many of them are on beaches.  (If you have no idea what I'm
talking about here, fine... this is an area that I want to write myself anyway
^_^)</p>

<p>There is basically no combat here, except far <q>underground</q>, where there
are dreamlike dark cloud creatures which may attack you sporadically.  They are
not openly malicious but they can do damage.</p>

<p>This is the world where the fuzzies live.  They look like colored
Teddy-bears; unique ones will be more brightly colored and sometimes
irridescent.  They are very shy, but not at all violent.  The fuzzies are
pretty safe from natural predators.  Strangely, they seem to have a similar
biochemistry to the players; when you zap them, they enjoy it.  They can build
crude strange, crude-looking devices which can serve as batteries; high-level
unique fuzzies (as described above) can cause groups of them to build simple
charge converters and rare character customization devices as well.</p>

<h4>Dust: A High-Level World</h4>

<p>Dust is a much higher-level world, with a deeper and darker motif.  It is
very dangerous and quite violent.</p>

<p>You emerge inside an office building.  The corridor you're in is unmarked
and deathly silent.  Everything is coated with a few millimeters of fine,
yellow dust.  Through the windows and onto the street, you can see that this
dust is outside as well.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of walking, you'll come across a corridor which is
marred with charred black plastic, all centered around a particular area.  Very
soon after seeing that, a machine gun will drop out of the ceiling and point
straight at you. Clunk!  Clunk clunk... clank.  The machine gun is out of
ammunition and is harmless.  It is rusted straight through.  Obviously this
building has been in disrepair for quite some time.</p>

<p>Eventually you will come across a work area, with chairs at desks.  On each
of the chairs, the thin coating of dust will be piled as high as 10 or 20cm.
The occasional deep pile of dust will litter the floor.  </p>

<p>Out in the street, self-repairing self-evolving combat machines have had
quite a bit of time to adjust to this new reality and will destroy anything
that comes into the street with brutal efficiency.  You had better be prepared
to do battle with some of your more primitive mechanical cousins if you're
going to make it out of the city alive.</p>

<p>There are very few artifacts within the city; mostly, small capsules of a
liquid spray which will near-instantly corrode any organic materials you're
holding.  (The dust it leaves behind -- a faint yellow color -- is completely
inert.)</p>

<p>Once you get to the edge of the city, you'll find it's surrounded by a wall
which is several hundred meters high.  You can climb it, or rocket over it if
you have a jet-pack of some kind.  Once you've gotten over it, though, there is
a civilization on the outside of the wall which is definitely not happy to see
you coming over it.  Things do occasionally make it over the wall, but they're
always met with the best-armed army that the medium tech-level civilization
living outside can muster.  You especially they don't like.</p>

<p>It's pretty much impossible to make friends with anybody there, if they see
you coming over the wall.  There are other ways to get there, though, although
they will involve puzzle-solving.</p>

<p>The friendlies in this world are the humans on the outside of the wall.
They're tough to befriend, but they can make you some really kick-ass stuff if
you manage it.  They're also under attack periodically from their environment;
animals from the surrounding forests or machines who make it over the wall.
They are pretty well armed though, so raids on a <q>herd</q> here will almost
certainly fail unless the attacker is very well prepared indeed.</p>

Divunal is more like an epic poem than the typical prose of other online games.
