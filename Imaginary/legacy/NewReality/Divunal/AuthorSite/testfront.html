				<p>
				  Divunal is a text based multiplayer game made with the
				  Twisted Reality engine. It unlike most MUDs in that it
				  praises roleplaying and problem solving over violence, and
				  it is unlike most MOOs in that it has a structured,
				  consistent world, with balanced rules and statistics, much
				  like a tabletop roleplaying game. However, unlike any
				  traditional RPG, the rule system is completely transparent
				  to the players, and you'll never encounter a level,
				  statistic, or percentage while playing your character. In
				  short, it combines the best parts of all three of those
				  types of games, and avoids most of their limitations.
				</p>
				<p>
				  In addition to it's engine and design, Divunal is a huge,
				  constantly expanding world, with an extremely interactive
				  environment and an unusual cast of characters. As your
				  character, you will find yourself lost in a ruined city
				  of amnesiacs, attempting to rediscover the complex history
				  of your world and solve it's mysteries. In what has been
				  compared to a shoving match between Roger Zelazny
				  and Manga-style Anime, you will uncover ancient knowledge,
				  meddle in the affairs of gods, and toy with a power that
				  threatens to destroy what's left of your world in a
				  unique, genre-transcending plot whose conclusion will be 
				  based on your actions.
				</p>
				  If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to
				  subscribe to our <a
				  href="/mailman/listinfo/divunal-list">Divunal
				  Mailing List</a> for more information on the game
				  and how to become a playtester. Our formal Divunal
				  page will be up soon, so come back and visit often.

				  If you can give a brief synopsys of your character's
				  appearance (including what clothes they'd be wearing
				  upon entrance to divunal) we'll start handing out
				  accounts very soon (within the week).  Even if you
				  already have an account, please re-apply for one,
				  because (a) that way we'll be able to take these
				  emails and build a list of everyone who has an
				  account and is helping out, and (b) we've just added
				  clothing to Divunal, so this way we'll remember to
				  give you all clothes.

				  In an attempt to better support those users who have
				  been involved in this project for some time now,
				  we've put up these web pages and made some files
				  available for download so everyone can begin
				  catching up to us.  We know that the site is quite
				  incomplete, but in the interests of getting a site
				  out there quickly, we're publishing this page today.
				  We have also added several mailinglists and put up a
				  permanent address for the Divunal server
				  (reality.divunal.com) where you can connect if you
				  already have an account.  Thanks for helping out,
				  everybody!
				</p>
				<p>
				  If you're not somebody that knows their way around
				  Divunal / Twisted Reality just yet, please send us
				  requests for improvement of the website (<a
				  href="mailto:glyph@divunal.com">glyph</a>, <a
				  href="mailto:tenth@divunal.com">tenth</a>) and we'll
				  try to respond (in order of priority of course) to
				  those problems which you've had figuring out what's
				  going on here.  I know that "what the heck is
				  divunal" is probably going to be the first question
				  has on their mind, so we're working on that.
