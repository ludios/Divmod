<BR>Plot elements:
<P>Tenth's house is large, and in some cases geometrically impossible. Each floor of the building is at 90 degree angle to the floors
above and below it. As if this wasn't enough, each window and door leads
to a different location, making his mansion a sort of dimensional hub attached
to the library. It also contains a number of strange machines, some of
which govern the state and destination of the doorways.
<P>Tenth is a happy, well-adjusted guy in Divunal,
but he was much different on earth. The only obvious visible remnant of
this past is the picture hanging in his entrance hall, but there are a
few other places in his house where the insanity is leaking through. He
really is in his own little world, and as a plot, getting through his house
could get more and more like playing MindWalker. Also, he could disappear
into the dark part of his house/mind for a while, giving players an opportunity
to save him and get on his favorable, pocketwatch-distributing side. Or
they could just provide a source of various creepy places to explore, with
the players eventually able to make the connection to Tenth's personality.
