How to implement Actions!
=========================

Define the parser, an english.Subparser subclass

Register the parser, english.registerSubparser(subparserinstance)

Define/implement/whatever the interfaces associated with the action,
register the adapters for your objects to them in the stupid crappy
lib directory (soon to change). Especially remember the iface for the
player! IFooActor.

Ensure that the module that defines your action and parser is imported
somewhere!
