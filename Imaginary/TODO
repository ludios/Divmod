Near term

    Text markup (colors, etc)

    Help system

        Automatically generated syntax tips

    Command disambiguation (menu driven, I hope)

Long term

    Non-monolithic, non-forking persistence system

    Working rebuild command, either using become-based rebuild() or service
    migration

    Command plugin system (maybe, eh, I dunno)

    Detailed state and state transition documentation for all objects
    (ongoing)
