<center><b><font size=+4>How To Be An Author</font></b></center>

<p>
<b>What is an author, anyway?</b>
<blockquote>
When we say "author" in the context of the Divunal project,
we're referring to anyone who contributes to the development and operation
of the game, by creating new rooms and objects, programming new features
and verbs, or playing specifically designed characters to further the development of the plot. Some people may only do one of these things, and others may
contribute to all of them and more... But in short, authors are the people
who help make the game happen.
<p>
In exchange for their help, authors get their Divunal accounts for free,
and may customize their character(s) in any way they wish. They have access
to special authoring information, like this web page, and may even get
to play one of the Gods of Divunal, and have a profound effect on the plot
of the game. However, with great power comes great responsibility.
</blockquote>
<b>What do you mean by "great responsibility"? Does this involve The Force?</b>
<blockquote>
No. But while authors exist outside many of the systems that
govern normal players, they must still act appropriately whenever they
appear in character, and maintain the theme and consistency of the game
in their creations. Divunal was designed with a very specific theme in
mind, and authors are expected to respect the intentions of the game when
creating new features.
<p>
Authors are encouraged to test out any new ideas that may be
potentially useful to the game without asking permission, whether to
write code or to design new areas.  If you're wondering if something
is possible to do, try doing it before you talk about it as a
theoretical possibility; even if your idea is deemed unacceptable by
the Implementors, you will still have learned something about the
world.  <em>However, any such experimentation should be confined to
places where you are sure players cannot go.</em> Do not close off
your demo areas behind a particularly difficult lock to pick, or a
door which requires a high strength to get to -- make them completely
separated from the game, with no method of entrance except for a
god powers (like "gate" or "visit").
<p>
Authors must also be respectful of other authors; Adding to, changing,
destroying, or otherwise screwing around with something that doesn't belong
to you is an extremely bad thing to do, and will get you in lots of trouble
very quickly.  We have neglected to include any code-level protections in the
server's software in order to allow artifacts and effects from different areas
to interact easily, but this does not mean that you should feel welcome to 
change anything about another author's areas (except perhaps minor corrections such as spelling). If you want to do anything that involves a pre-existing place,
object, or character, you <i>must contact the creator of that thing <u>first</u>.</i>Even if you just want to connect your new set of areas to an existing room,you must still make sure that you have permission to do so.
<p>
When appearing in character, you are always expected to act appropriately.
However, as an author, you must be especially careful in your dealings
with players and the world of Divunal as a whole. While you can easily
use the authoring verbs to solve or bypass puzzles and other features of
the game, you shouldn't do it while players are around. Someone put a lot
of work into creating them, and they are there for the players to enjoy.
"Cheating" in front of the players or giving the solution away can ruin
everyone else's enjoyment of the game. This is especially important in
the case of&nbsp; objects which an author has placed as a prize for the
first player who is able to work their way through a certain situation...
It was created for the players to win, and stealing it for yourself is
incredibly greedy and detrimental to the game. If you <i>really </i>want
something you've seen in in another author's area, consider building one
of your own, or asking them how they made it.
<p>
You should also keep track of what your individual character(s) should
know about the Divunal plot... The game itself is one big mystery, and
you really shouldn't give away any important pieces of information about
it unless you have good reason to. Even if you are playing one of the Gods
of Divunal, your character still probably shouldn't know everything there
is to know about Divuthan weapons technology just because you, the author,
happened to read the documentation for it. This game is primarily about
exploring a strange world and discovering its history, and spoiling the
surprises is just as bad as stealing the treasure from the end of someone's
dungeon.
</blockquote>
<b>There are a lot of guidelines here. So... what if I do happen to screw
up?</b>
<blockquote>
Well, we'd rather you didn't, but we pride ourselves on being
friendly and understanding people. HOWEVER, if you're being intentionally
malicious or disobedient, or if you just prove to be more trouble than
you're worth, you'll probably find yourself without any of the benefits
of authoring, including your character. Much like with regular players,
extreme or repeat offenders may be banned from the game entirely. Period.
There's nothing more dangerous than a careless or destructive author, and
while it probably isn't anything personal on our end, we really don't need
any help screwing up our game.&nbsp; :-)
<p>
But that's assuming that you've really gone out of your way to be a
dickweed. If you simply make a mistake, let us know as soon as possible,
and we'll let you know what you can do to rectify the situation. This isn't
an easy job, and Divunal is about as different from other MOOs and MUDs
as a text-based game can be... we're very understanding about this, and
we're doing our best to make it easy to be an author, and to keep the rules
clearly defined. But remember:

<p>
<b><font color="#3333FF">IF YOU AREN'T SURE ABOUT SOMETHING, PLEASE
ASK US FIRST, BEFORE YOU MAKE A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MISTAKE.</font></b></center>
<p>They're really words to live by as an author. We'd be more than happy
to help you out, and we would <i>much</i> rather answer a stupid question
10 times than have one mistake go horribly wrong. Divunal administrators
can be reached by email, AOL Instant Messenger, or on the #divunal IRC
channel almost constantly, and questions like yours are one of the main
reasons they make themselves more available...&nbsp; So don't hesitate
to speak up before it's too late.
