0.9.0 (2006-06-12):
  - Fixed a bug where nested fragment sending rarely worked.
  - Sending large strings in Athena arguments and results is now faster due to
    less unnecessary unicode character quoting.
  - Module objects are now automatically created for all Athena imports.
  - Better error reporting for fragments which are rendered without a parent.
  - Disconnect notifiers in Athena pages will no longer clobber each other.
  - Many optimizations to javascript initialization.
  - Javascript packages are now defined with less boilerplate: a filesystem
    convention similar to Python's for module naming, plus one declaration in a
    Nevow plugin which indicates the directory, rather than a declaration for
    each module.
  - Updated README to refer to Athena rather than LivePage
