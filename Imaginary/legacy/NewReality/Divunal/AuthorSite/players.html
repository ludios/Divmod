<B>Characters</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The statistics and rules used in Divunal were designed to fit the theme of the game as closely as possible, as well as to avoid a number of problems common to similar games... Some decisions may seem arbitrary, unusual, or just plain stupid, but keep in mind that Divunal is pointedly different than MUDs and most other MOOs, and the rules are meant to maintain those differences.
<p>
Player characters can be generated manually, by creating them with <a href="verbs.html#adduser">adduser</a>, <a href="verbs.html#describe">describing</a> them, and assigning them statistics, but it is our intent for them to be easily randomized, and you really should look at a randomly generated character first to get an idea of what standards they follow. Randomly generated characters are also assigned a randomized description, partially based on their Genome. This is far from perfect, but once again, it provides a good example to work from.
<p>
Characters are assigned a number of statistics when they are generated, but by default, all statistics can default to 0... This is especially good for efficiency, because not having a numeric variable assigned is the same as having a 0. (Thus a character who starts with no stats with be normal and thoroughly average in everything, which is okay.) When manually describing the character, you should hint at their obvious characteristics (being strong, fast and agile, or unhealthy), and keep the general <a href = "definitions.html#divuen">Divu'en characteristics</a> in mind.
<P>

<B>Genome</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Genome is the character's innate physical characteristics. Together, the values that make up the Genome form a ratio for the character's initial state and advancement. If the values are all at 0 (or have not been set), The player is perfectly average; All of their abilities are equal, and start out at a decent but unremarkable level. Genome values can be adjusted to anywhere between -1 and +1, but normal player characters should go more than 0.8 or 0.9 in either direction, for a number of reasons. The Genome values are as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Strength:</B> Physical strength. This affects their weight capacity, hand-to-hand and thrown weapon damage, and strength-based skills. Players with a high strength often appear to be "large" or "muscular" in their description.
<P>
<B>Endurance:</B> Pain tolerance, physical health, and motive energy. This affects how much punishment a character can take before passing out, as well as how much they can do before getting tired. A high Endurance will make random characters look more healthy (in combination with other physical stats) and a low endurance will make them appear pale or sickly.
<P> 
<B>Agility:</B> Overall coordination and balance. This affects the character's ability to move and carry unwieldy objects, avoid being struck by attacks, and move quickly on foot, and is the basis for a number of athletic skills. A high agility causes random characters to appear "slender" or "graceful", depending on their other stats.
<p>
<B>Dexterity:</B> Fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. This affects the character's ability to carry numerous objects at once, perform delicate tasks, attack and use weapons accurately, and is the basis for many related skills. Dexterity rarely affects random descriptions.
<P>
<B>Psyche:</B> Willpower, psychic aptitude and sensitivity, and Divuthan heritage. Psyche can be used to determine if a player can resist mind control or fear, or notice something "wrong" about a place or person, and determines their aptitude at learning and using psychic powers. Players with a high Psyche often have Divuthan characteristics (white/silver/black hair, silver/red/translucent eyes, grey, pale, or white complexion) 
<P>
<B>Memory:</B> Ability to remember complex information, and retention of old memories. This is a double edged sword, allowing characters to memorize numerous and complicated magical spells, as well as to "remember" important information about certain people and places, but it also acts as a limitation; Characters with a high memory keep much more of their societal instincts, and will often resist any attempt at unprovoked violence. Random characters with a high memory sometimes look more peaceful or happy than other Divu'en, as they have not completely lost their identity and beliefs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
When assigning Genome values, aim to keep the character's point total at zero; Any advantages they have should be balanced out by weaknesses somewhere else. Also, keep in mind that while a character with all 0.0s is not exceptional in any way, they're still pretty good at everything, and have no particular flaws... It's not really a bad thing at all.
<P>
These attributes are never displayed to the players, so they can only judge ability by vague descriptions and through direct experience. This helps players to roleplay the "rediscovery" of their character, as well as discouraging them from focusing too much on their character as a set of numbers. It also helps to make a combat a sketchy, unpredictable situation that isn't entered into lightly.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Mojo</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
For lack of a better word, we refer to the Player's "experience", divine favor, and general coolness as Mojo. Mojo begins, as most values do, at 0.0, and increases very slowly from there. Once per day, Mojo is increased by a very small amount if the player has logged in during the last 24 hours, and a larger amount is given if the players has been tagged by one of the Authors as having been a good roleplayer or otherwise good to the game at large. Players receive additional bonuses for completing puzzles and other tasks, but these values are all very small, and Mojo increases more slowly the higher it is.
<P>
Functionally, the character's current Mojo is added to Genome when their current value is desired. It is generally impossible for a player character to have a Mojo much higher than 1.0, but that would leave our abovementioned "perfectly average character" with exceptional stats across the board, a good reminder of how "completely average" quickly becomes "well rounded" with experience.  :-)
<P>
Divunal is not about being a statistics accountant; We've kept character advancement simple because it is completely transparent to the player. Characters who log on frequently, roleplay well, and solve puzzles are the ones who advance the most, and no additional mathematics is required on the part of the player in order to stay competitive with everyone else.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>State</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A character's current state of being is mostly covered in terms of their Health and Stamina values. Stamina represents the character's current energy, and ranges from -1 to the character's Endurance. Health represents the character's physical integrity and well being, and always ranges from -1 to +1. If a character runs out of Stamina, they will be unable to perform tiring actions until they recover, and fall unconscious. If a character runs out of Health, they collapse and die shortly afterwards. Stamina will recover completely in about 10 real time minutes, but it cannot be higher than the character's current Health. Their Health, on the other hand, takes about 24 hours to regenerate completely, although it will usually only be reduced by deadly weapons (swords, guns, powerful magic, etc.)... Most blunt weapons and hand to hand attacks only inflict Stamina damage.
<P>
While characters technically default to 0 in both Health and Stamina (halfway towards the minimum) they will actually be "fully charged" the first time their state is called for, due to some magic in the regeneration code. And speaking of defaults, it's extremely bad to assign an Endurance Genome of less than -0.8... Even the lightest injury or shock will knock the character unconscious, and they will be too weak to accomplish a lot of normal tasks.
<P>
In keeping with our transparent interface, players cannot determine their exact state, but they can get an indication of how tired/injured they are, and a terse version of that text will be appended to their description if it is extremely obvious. While players can still tell what kind of shape their character is in, they never get an exact amount, and even then the values are scaled to the character's attributes... This keeps numbers out of the character's roleplaying, and makes combat a lot more unpredictable and unattractive as a dispute solving option.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Special Attributes</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Certain attributes are always set to 0 initially, and will remain that way almost all the time, except when modified by certain rare and special effects. It is very important that they be maintained correctly (and reset to 0 when appropriate), so use extra care when designing Things that use them. Once again, These are never inherently noticable to players, and only become apparent through their effects.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Violent:</B> A boolean flag, which, of course, defaults to False. This is flag is set to True on any player who attempts to attack another player whose Violent flag was False. (It essentially records whether or not the character has "thrown the first punch" in terms of interpersonal violence at any point in the past.) It will also activate if the character attempts to kill another player, regardless of that player's status.
<P>
<B>Asshole:</B> A boolean flag which is activated and set to True if the character does something particularly annoying. This can be set by a god with the Asshole command, and will turn on automatically if the character attempts to do something unpleasant but is prevented from actually doing it for some reason.
<P>
<B>Healing Factor:</B> At 0.0, this value does nothing, but when set to a float between -1 and +1, it alters the player's ability to recover lost Health and Stamina: The required healing time is multiplied by the Healing Factor + 1, so Setting it to -0.5 would halve the time needed to fully recover, and setting it to 2 would double it.
<P>
<B>Armor:</B> Some forms of clothing and artifacts provide protection against attacks... Armor normally starts at 0, but the closer it gets to -1, the more damage it will absorb from incoming attacks. (Armor should never really get to -1, but then, it's effectiveness is also governed by Coverage, and not all attacks and damage will take it into account.
<P>
<B>Coverage:</B> Also modified by special clothing, Coverage indicates the chance that the armor will protect against a given attack.The more area covered by worn armor, the higher Coverage will be (up to 1.0, where Armor will always protect the character.) Remember that some attacks and sources of damage just don't care about Armor, though.
<P>
<B>Protection:</B> Protection is usually only set by magical spells and artifacts, and functions identically to armor, except that it does not take coverage into account, and is much more likely to be effective against unusual sources of damage.<BR>
