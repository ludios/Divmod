  <b>1. What is ClickChronicle?</b><br />

  ClickChronicle keeps a record of your web browsing and allows you to
  search all the web pages that you have visited.<p />

  <b>2. How does ClickChronicle work?</b><br />

  ClickChronicle has 2 parts: the click-recording extension for Firefox
  and the clickchronicle.com web application. Once installed the
  extension securely sends the web address of each page that you visit
  to clickchronicle.com. Once clickchronicle.com receives a click from
  the extension, it indexes the page so you can search (and
  find) it later.<p />

  <b>3. How do I use ClickChronicle?</b><br />

  To use ClickChronicle you have to create an account at
  clickchronicle.com: <a href="/signup">signup</a> and
  install the <a href="/static/js/clickchronicle.user.js">clickchronicle greasemonkey script</a><p />

  <b>4. What about my privacy?</b><br />
        At ClickChronicle, you own your data. Your clicks belong to you and we don't 
        share them with others. Your data is not trapped at ClickChronicle and at 
        any point you can download or erase all the clicks you have stored with 
        us. Divmod (ClickChronicle's parent) is a member of attentiontrust.org, 
        an organization founded to protect privacy and rights to data. 
        <p />
  ClickChronicle does aggreagate anonymous click data to help us tune
  the system and for features like our "What's popular?"  section,
  however there is no way for someone to find out who contributed which
  click. You can also opt out of the anonymous click aggregation by
  logging in and going to the Preferences section of clickchronicle.com.
  <p />
  ClickChronicle is open-source and, if you are REALLY paranoid, you can
  download and run it yourself.<p />

  <b>5. Is ClickChronicle secure?</b><br />

  Yes. ClickChronicle uses encrypted connections to send your click data
  to our server. We also use encrypted connections when you log in to
  search and browse your data. For encryption we use 128-bit https, the
  same security that is used by sites like Amazon and Ebay for credit
  card transactions.<p />

  <b>6. Are there any sites that are not recorded by ClickChronicle?</b><br />

  Yes. If a site requires a login (such as your online banking site) we can
  not record the information since we can not log in as you (only you
  can do that).<p />

  <b>7. Can I exclude certain sites from being recorded?</b><br />

  Yes. Once logged into clickchronicle.com it is easy to configure
  specific sites to be ignored.<p />

  <b>8. Is there a limit to number of clicks recorded?</b><br />
        Yes. Initially ClickChronicle will remember and index your last 1000 clicks. 
        Once you reach 1000 we will forget the oldest clicks first. 
        <p />

  <b>9. Is there any way to increase the 1000 click limit?</b><br />
        Yes. You can sign up for our paid service. There will also be bonuses and 
        incentive programmes to reward fanatical users. 
        <p />

  <b>10. What are the differences between the free service and the paid
    service?</b><br />
        The paid service will offer far deeper history. It will also provides a 
        cache of visited pages so if an article moves or a site goes down you can 
        still find the information you were looking for. 
        <p />
