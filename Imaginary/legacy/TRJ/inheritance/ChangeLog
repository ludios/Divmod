	* GunPut.java: Now you can load the gun while sitting down!  How
	novel!

	* Translate.java: Added a tranlate verb for Lord Rutherford's
	Practical Guide To Egyptology. Should be interesting.

	* inheritance/GameOver.java: ***** You have died. *****

	* inheritance/mummy/MummyDistracted.java:
	* inheritance/mummy/MummyTake.java:
	* inheritance/mummy/RotHandler.java:
	* inheritance/mummy/SarcophagusOpenEvent.java:
	A first pass at implementing a mummy.

	* inheritance/gun/RackSlide.java: Now handles many situations
	correctly that it could not before, not appearing to eject phantom
	bullets (and not getting null pointer exceptions). And fixed the
	descriptive text that I unfixed in a brief scuffle with CVS.

	* inheritance/gun/BulletGet.java: Now has more better grammer in
	that there descriptive text. (okay, well, more commas.)

	* inheritance/gun/ClipLook.java: It seems strange to me that all
	of the gun verbs are so totally broken. You can't even look at the
	clip... Wasn't this all working the last time we were working in
	Inheritance?

	* inheritance/gun/BulletGet.java: Either I'm confused or this verb
	is. I think I fixed it. Again.

	* inheritance/gun/BulletPut.java: Fixed a typo... Bullets and
	Clips now have different identifying properties, thank goodness.

	* inheritance/gun/RackSlide.java: Added a sanity check in
	RackSlide... The gun still needs to start it's career with the
	slide locked, though, or it will get null pointers, and be
	physically impossible as well.
