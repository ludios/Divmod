&gt; look<br>
<br>
Office<br>
<br>
A cubical gray concrete room, lit somewhat unsteadily by a  <br>
flickering overhead light. A black metal table is set against the <br>
wall, strewn with papers and set with a large glass case labeled <br>
"Skrill Habitat". Doorframes are set into the east and west walls.<br>
<br>
   A paperback edition of "The Skrill Handbook" is on the table.<br>
 <br>
   Obvious exits: East, West<br>
<br>
&gt; look at case<br>
<br>
A rectangular glass case, with a white plastic placard attached <br>
labeling it as a "Skrill Habitat". The top of the case is open, and <br>
the bottom is strewn with what appears to be dirt, ashes, and charred <br>
scraps of wood.<br>
<br>
   There is a white skrill in the case.<br>
<br>
&gt; look at skrill<br>
<br>
The skrill is an oblong, segmented wormlike creature, with grayish <br>
white rubbery skin. While thick around the middle of it's length, it <br>
tapers towards each end, both of which terminate in a mass of gently <br>
undulating tendrils. It is pulsating slowly but steadily, and <br>
emitting a faint mumbling noise with each expansion.<br>
<br>
&gt; get book<br>
<br>
You get the paperback edition of "The Skrill Handbook"<br>
<br>
&gt; read paperback<br>
<br>
The book is tattered and somewhat faded, but has information on both <br>
white and red skrills, along with general skrill care and handling.<br>
<br>
&gt; read about white skrills<br>
<br>
(in the paperback edition of "The Skrill Handbook")<br>
<br>
You flip through the White Skrill section. <br>
<br>
"White Skrills, and the older variant strain of Gray Skrills, are<br>
engineered for the processing of chemical and material waste, and<br>
bred for docile behavior. Unlike the older Gray strain, White Skrills <br>
are especially friendly, and will tolerate being handled by untrained <br>
personnel. <br>
<br>
Like all common skrill, their flexible bodies allow them to squeeze<br>
into small spaces; In White Skrills, this is useful for navigating<br>
small areas such as ventilation systems and the exhaust vents, valves<br>
and combustion chambers of industrial machinery.<br>
<br>
Skrill can metabolize a variety of materials, and while the resulting<br>
secretions vary based on ingested content, a great deal of effort has<br>
been spent to ensure that all are non-toxic and generally more useful<br>
than the original waste in the case of the White and Gray strains.<br>
<br>
While well behaved, White Skrill have somewhat of a reputation for<br>
eating their way out of containers; A glass or metal enclosure is<br>
recommended for long term storage, and certified Skrill handling gear<br>
should be used in the field."<br>
<br>
&gt; get skrill<br>
<br>
The White Skrill is rather heavy and rubbery, and shifts it's weight <br>
in response to your grasp; You'll need both hands free to carry it <br>
properly.<br>
<br>
&gt; put all on table.<br>
<br>
You put the wrench, the ignition key, and the paperback edition of <br>
"The Skrill Handbook" on the table.<br>
<br>
&gt; get skrill<br>
<br>
You take both ends of the skrill and lift it carefully. It writhes <br>
inquisitively in your hands for a moment, sampling the air with <br>
it's tendrils, and then settles back into a slow, rythmic pulsation.<br>
<br>
&gt; go east<br>
<br>
Machine Room<br>
<br>
A long, rectangular gray concrete room, lit by a flickering <br>
cylindrical light attached to the ceiling in a metal frame. The far <br>
end of the room is dominated by a large, complicated looking piece of <br>
machinery, attached to a large metal tank on one side and a console <br>
on the other. A door opens out of the room to the west.<br>
<br>
   There is a mop here.<br>
<br>
   Obvious exits: West<br>
<br>
&gt; look at machine<br>
<br>
The machine is dirty and tarnished, originally built from some silvery<br>
metal that has since become grayish and coppery in spots. The main body<br>
is a large, blocky case with a rounded top, set with protruding<br>
cylinders that have stained themselves and the case of the machine<br>
around them with oil and brownish grease. On the side of the case,<br>
perpendicular to the cylinders, is what appears to be an exhaust vent<br>
with a grated cover attached.<br>
<br>
&gt; open cover<br>
<br>
The vent cover is fastened shut with a bolt; You would need to unscrew <br>
that bolt to open it.<br>

Utility Closet<br>
<br>
A small walk-in closet that wouldn't be uncomfortably small had it <br>
not been crammed full of shelves and lockers.<br>
<br>
   There is an empty plastic bottle, and a plastic bottle full of <br>
blue liquid on the shelf.<br>
<br>
   There is a plastic cylinder full of brown liquid in the locker, <br>
and a plastic skrill net hanging from a hook in the locker.<br>
<br>
&gt; get net<br>
<br>
You take the skrill net from the hook in the locker.<br>
<br>
&gt; put skrill in net<br>
<br>
You ease one end of the skrill into the net, and it wriggles itself <br>
the rest of the way inside, probing with it's tendrils.<br>
<br>
&gt; east<br>
<br>
Office<br>
<br>
There is a soft, wet thud as the skrill wriggles out of the net and <br>
lands on the floor.<br>
<br>
&gt; look at skrill net<br>
<br>
A purse-like net made from smooth white plastic cord. The top end of<br>
the net has a carrying handle attached, and is ringed with a<br>
pullstring that passes through the net and a plastic clasp embossed<br>
with the image of a skrill. The net is currently untied and open.<br>
<br>
&gt; get skrill<br>
<br>
You take both ends of the skrill and lift it carefully. It shifts and <br>
undulates in your hands, as though making itself comfortable, and <br>
then resumes it's rythmic pulsation.<br>
<br>
&gt; put skrill in net<br>
<br>
You ease one end of the skrill into the net, and it wriggles itself<br>
the rest of the way inside, probing with it's tendrils.<br>
<br>
&gt; close net<br>
<br>
You pull the drawstring closed, and fasten it in place with the <br>
clasp.<br>
<br>
&gt; get all from table<br>
<br>
You take the wrench, the ignition key, and the paperback edition of<br>
"The Skrill Handbook" from the table.<br>

<br>
Machine Room<br>
<br>
&gt; unscrew cover<br>
<br>
(with wrench)<br>
<br>
You loosen the screw on the cover of the vent, and the grating swings <br>
loose out of the way.<br>
<br>
&gt; put skrill in vent<br>
<br>
You'll have to open the net to get the Skrill.<br>
<br>
&gt; open net<br>
<br>
You undo the clap on the skrill net and loosen the drawstring.<br>
<br>
&gt; put skrill in vent<br>
<br>
You ease one end of the skrill into the vent, and it slides itself <br>
eagerly inside.<br>

on the other. A door opens out of the room to the west.<br>
<br>
   There is a mop here.<br>
<br>
   Obvious exits: West<br>
<br>
You hear a faint scraping noise from the inside of the machine.<br>
<br>
&gt; wait<br>
<br>
Time passes.<br>
<br>
You hear some noises.<br>
<br>
&gt; wait<br>
<br>
Time passes.<br>
<br>
You hear a rough sliding sound, and a white skrill protrudes <br>
one end of itself from the open vent of the machine.<br>
<br>
&gt; put skrill in net<br>
<br>
You ease one end of the skrill into the net, and it wriggles itself<br>
the rest of the way inside, probing with it's tendrils.<br>
<br>
&gt; look at console<br>
<br>
The console is a small podium of burnished metal, attached to the <br>
machinery by a cluster of pipes and conduits. Set into the surface is <br>
a keyhole, a red button, a switch (set to "Safety"), and a circular <br>
glass display with a needle indicator and metered background that <br>
goes from 0 to 500 CTB. The needle rests at "0" at the far right.<br>
<br>
The skrill mumbles contentedly to itself.<br>
<br>
&gt; look at switch<br>
<br>
The switch has two positions, "Safety" and "Ignition". It is <br>
currently set to "Safety".<br>
<br>
&gt; flip switch<br>
<br>
You flip the switch to the "Ignition" position.<br>
<br>
There is a soft, wet thud as the skrill wriggles out of the net and<br>
lands on the floor.<br>
<br>
&gt; put key in keyhole<br>
<br>
You fit the ignition key in the console keyhole.<br>
<br>
The skrill lets out a satisfied warbling noise, and curls into a <br>
croissant-like ball on the floor.<br>
<br>
&gt; turn key<br>
<br>
You turn the key in the console keyhole. There is a metallic click <br>
followed by a faint humming from deep inside the console, and you <br>
smell a faint whiff of ozone.<br>
<br>
&gt; look at console<br>
<br>
The console is a small podium of burnished metal, attached to the<br>
machinery by a cluster of pipes and conduits. Set into the surface is<br>
a keyhole, a red button, a switch (set to "Ignition"), and a circular<br>
glass display with a needle indicator and metered background that<br>
goes from 0 to 500 CTB. The needle rests at "0" at the far right. <br>
You can hear a faint humming sound from somewhere inside it.<br>
<br>
&gt; press button<br>
<br>
You press the red button, and there is a hissing crackle from inside the<br>
console. The meter display jumps to 150 CTB for a moment, and you hear a<br>
rumbling sound from inside the machine, but it quickly subsides into a<br>
harsh grinding noise, and then silence, as the meter drops to 0 again.<br>

<br>
   There is a mop here. <br>
   There is a skrill here, curled up in a ball on the floor.<br>
<br>
   Obvious exits: West<br>
<br>
&gt; look skrill<br>
<br>
The skrill is an oblong, segmented wormlike creature, with grayish<br>
white rubbery skin. While thick around the middle of it's length, it<br>
tapers towards each end, both of which terminate in a mass of gently<br>
undulating tendrils. It is curled into a ball, and slowly expanding and <br>
contracting, emitting a satisified mumbling sound with each expansion.<br>
<br>
&gt; look at machine<br>
<br>
The machine is dirty and tarnished, originally built from some silvery<br>
metal that has since become grayish and coppery in spots. The main body<br>
is a large, blocky case with a rounded top, set with protruding<br>
cylinders that have stained themselves and the case of the machine<br>

perpendicular to the cylinders, is what appears to be an exhaust vent<br>
with a grated cover attached.<br>
<br>
&gt; look at vent<br>
<br>
The vent cover is currently hanging open, the bolt that normally holds <br>
it shut hanging loose from the vent itself.<br>
<br>
&gt; close vent<br>
<br>
(with wrench)<br>
<br>
You close the vent cover and screw the restraining bolt back into place.<br>
<br>
&gt; look at cylinders<br>
<br>
Three raised cylinders protrude from the rounded top of the machine. <br>
Each one is stained with brownish fluid where it joins the case, and the <br>
middle cylinder has a small hole in the top, heavily stained with <br>
brownish grease.<br>
<br>
&gt; put cylinder in cylinder<br>
<br>
The plastic cylinder is too big to fit into the machine cylinder.<br>
<br>
&gt; pour brown fluid into machine cylinder<br>
<br>
You pour the brown fluid from the plastic cylinder into the opening at <br>
the top of the machine cylinder.<br>
<br>
You hear muffled dripping and bubbling sounds from inside the main case <br>
of the machine.<br>
<br>
&gt; wait<br>
<br>
Time passes.<br>
<br>
The skrill lifts one end of itself, and produces a small carbon crystal <br>
from between it's tendrils, along with a satisfied gargling noise.<br>
<br>
The skrill drops the small carbon crystal.<br>
<br>
&gt; press button<br>
<br>
You press the red button, and there is a hissing crackle from inside the<br>
console. The meter display jumps to 150 CTB for a moment, and you hear a<br>
rumbling sound from inside the machine, which grows into a low, <br>
thrumming roar as the meter climbs into the 300 CTB range. The floor of <br>
the room seems to be vibrating along with the pulse of the machine, and <br>
you begin to hear a steady sloshing sound from inside the large metal <br>
tank.<br>
