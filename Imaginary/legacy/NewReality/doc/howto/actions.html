[ Forest Clearing ]
<p>A small clearing in the dense pine forest, still dusted with snow from the
previous winter. There is a pile of <a

methods, classes, and variables at the foot of a pine tree, along with a

<h2>Build Your Own Action</h2>

<p>Twisted Reality is a large and complex framework, but it's really designed
to make it simple to express one simple idea: people do stuff, with things.  In
order to allow this, there are three different kinds of things that TR will
talk about:

<ul>
  <li>Things: Objects that exist in the world.</li>
  <li>Actors: People who act on Things. (an Actor is a kind of Thing)</li>
  <li>Actions: Things that Actors can do.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It is pretty uncommon to define entirely new kinds of objects or people, so
this introductory tutorial focuses primarily on adding new kinds of Actions and
the things that support them.</p>

<p>Let's dive right in with a brief example of a full action, complete with
contrived wackiness:</p>

<p>There's quite a few things going on there, so let's take a look at it in
action.</p>
