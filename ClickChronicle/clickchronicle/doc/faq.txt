ClickChronicle FAQ

1. What is ClickChronicle?

ClickChronicle is allows you to search all the web
pages that you have recently visited.

2. How does ClickChronicle work?

ClickChronicle has 2 parts: the click-recording extension for FireFox
and the clickchronicle.com web application. Once installed the
extension securely sends the web address of each page that you visit
to clickchronicle.com. Once clickchronicle.com receives a click from
the extension, it fetches the content of the visted page and indexes
it so that you can search (and find) it later.

3. How do I use ClickChronicle?

To use ClickChronicle you have to create an account at
clickchronicle.com (signup here: www.clickchronicle.com/signup) and
install the firefox extension (www.clickchroniclle.com/extension)

4. What about my privacy?

At ClickChronicle, you own your data. Your clicks belong to you and we
don't share them with others. Your data is not trapped at
ClickChronicle and at any point you can download all the clicks you
have store with us. We are a member of attentiontrust.org and
organization founded to protect privacy and rights to data.

We do display anonymous click data for features like our "What's
popular?"  section, however there is no way for someone to find out
who contributed which click. You can also opt out of the anonymous
click aggregation by going to the Preferences section of
clickchronicle.com once you are logged in.

5. Is ClickChronicle secure?

Yes. ClickChronicle uses encrypted connections to send your click data
to our server. We also use encrypted connections when you log in to
search and browse your data. For encyption we use 128-bit https, the
same security that is used by sites like Amazon and Ebay for credit
card transactions.

Yes. If a site requires a login (such as your online banking site) we can
not record the information since we can not log in as you (only you
can do that).

Yes. Once logged into clickchronicle.com it is easy to tell use to
ignore specific sites.

8. Is there a limit to number of clicks recorded?

Yes. Initially ClickChronicle will remember and index your last 500
clicks. Once you reach 500 we will forget the oldest clicks first.

9. Is there any way to increase the 500 click limit?

Yes. You can either sign up for our paid service or you can help
spread the word and sign up new ClickChronicle users.

10. What are the differences between the free service and the paid
    service?

The paid service offers far deeper history (10,000 clicks
vs. 500). The paid service also provides a cache of visited pages so
if an article moves or a site goes down you can still find the
information you were looking for.

11. What technology is used by ClickChronicle?

programming language, the Twisted networking framework, Divmod Axiom,
