<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+4>Common Divunal Classes</FONT></CENTER>
<P>You can conserve memory and time in creating your objects by <a href = "verbs.html#extend">Extending</a> them from a Class_Object. This causes them to inherit all of the properties of the Class_Object, except for Name, Description, and Aliases (other names). For example, you could make a wearable shirt by simply drawing a shirt, describing it, and extending it from Class_Shirt. That saves you the trouble of having to enable it to the Wear verb and assign all of the locations it covers (left arm, right arm, chest) yourself.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Character Classes</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Class_Player:</B> The basic "playable character" class, this includes verbs that all characters need to have... Look, Take, Drop, various emotes, etc. It also gives the character a password, and allows players who know that password to log in as that character.
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Class_Human:</B> An extension of Class_Player for human characters (the Gods of Divunal). This adds the various inherent Godly powers, like <a href = "verbs.html#gate">Gate</a> and <a href = "verbs.html#scrutinize">Scrutinize</a>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Room Classes</FONT>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Class_Dark Room:</B> This gives rooms the additional isLit property, and a number of event handlers which cause players who enter and leave the room to react accordingly. Dark Rooms remain dark until there is an object in the room (carried by a player, inside an open container, etc.) with an "isLit" property set to "true".
<P>
<B>Class_Surface Room:</B> (Not quite working yet) This defines the room as being on the surface of a body of water; Players will occasionally fail to move if they can't pass Swimming checks, and in the event of such a failure, they will often sink (be pushed through the "down" exit of the room, if available). A Surface Room can be used to represent a room with about 5' of water, but it can be made much deeper by adding a down exit to a Submerged Room.
<P>
<B>Class_Submerged Room:</B> (Not quite working yet) This defines a room as being completely underwater; Players in underwater rooms must pass a swimming test before they can move, and will pass out and drown after an ammount of time based on their Endurance. (Drowned characters will normally just take a bunch of health damage and wash up in some other room.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Object Classes</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Class_Door:</b> This makes a generic door, which can be used to <a href = "verbs.html#obstruct">obstruct</a> an exit. It includes the Open/Close verbs, as well as default messages and aliases ("door", "doorway").
<P>
<B>Class_SmallBook:</b> Small Books gain a simple Read verb, along with a "book text" string that will be returned to the character when the book is read. This is meant more for short messages, notes, or summaries of complete books ("This is a dull, meandering account of the history of rice production in a country referred to as Northwestern Iadeonesia... it is so tedious and pointless that you can't bring yourself to keep reading it."
<P>
<B>Class_Container:</b> Containers are Locations, and include a verb which allows players to Get/Put objects in and out of them.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Class_Closeable Container</b> (Not quite working yet) A container, with an additional verb for opening and closing it. (You cannot look at or take objects in closed containers.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Class_Book:</b> Books inherit the TomePage and TomeWrite verbs, which allow the creator to enter in a large string for each page ("write 1 in book" will opena dialogue to write page 1), and let other players read the book (reading the book will display the current page, which can be selected with "turn next in book" or "turn prev in book".
<B>Class_Bookshelf:</b> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Clothing Classes</FONT>
