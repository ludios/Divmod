	<p><B>Panel 1:</b><br><tt>Tenth and maxwell are in the foreground. Tsiale and Yumeika are visible further off in the background, talking to one another.</tt>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Maxwell: "Well, have you had any other ideas on how to make Divunal more of a lucrative business venture?"
	  </p>
	  <p>Tenth: "Well, most roleplayers are males in their late teens to early twenties, but I had some ideas of how to make it interesting to a wider demographic."
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Panel 2:</b><br><tt>Tenth is turned towards Tsiale and Yumeika, who are holding hands in the background, looking confused. Maxwell looks on, also confused.</tt>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Tenth: "Excuse me, could you stand a little closer together? And hold hands, please?"
	  </p>
	  <p>Maxwell: "And what, pray tell, does this accomplish?" 
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Panel 4:</b><br><tt>Tenth is now turned towards Maxwell. In the background, Tsiale and Yumeika have little psychic squiggles over their heads, and have gone angrily semi-superdeformed, to the point of developing little pointy teeth.</tt>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Tenth: "Well, that's not the whole effect right there... Next we'd put up a "Red Hot Lesbians" sign and start charging people $19.95 an hour to get in."
	  </p>
	  <p>Maxwell: "Hmm."
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Panel 5:</b><br><tt>Tenth looks over at Tsiale and Yumeika, who are now each raising one hand, which is crackling with Anime energy. They look REALLY pissed.</tt>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Tenth: "Quick! Change the sign to "Red Hot Angry Lesbians" and double the price!"
	  </p>
	  <p>Maxwell is simply holding one hand over his face.
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Panel 6:</b><br><tt>Yumeika and Tsiale's crackling energy things are shooting a lightning bolt off the top of the panel. Tenth is a black sillhoutte with hair sticking out in the center of a blusish column of fire that also goes off the top of the panel, labeled "FROTZ". Maxwell is still holding one hand over his face.</tt>
	</p>
	<p><b>Panel 7:</b><br><tt>Tenth is a dishevelled black sillhouette with eyes.Tsiale and Yumeika are still glaring at him, now in a less deformed but still evil and satisfied way, and Maxwell is back to normal.</tt>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Tenth: "Or I could just drop the whole idea before someone erases me."
	  </p>
	  <p>Maxwell: "That too."
