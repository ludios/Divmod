Greetings, Claimant!

Your grandfather left you a letter here, but it was long, and boring.
I've taken the liberty of replacing it with a condensed, more precise
version.

The salient points are:

    *) Your grandfather was insane, and he babbles extensively when he
    writes personal and business corresponances.

    *) You are cursed, and doomed.  Servants of the "old ones" will be
    here to consume your soul shortly.

    *) Despite the fact that it is impossible for a mortal to overcome
    such a fate, if you do *not* overcome it, you will be responsible
    for the destruction of civilisation as we know it.

    *) Iä!

    *) Scattered throughout the mansion in no particular order are
    clues to your grandfather's insanity, his descent into the
    netherworld, and your possible salvation.  No detail was, or will
    be given on what these clues are, and you're lucky if you can find
    them.

Please feel free to contact us if you have requests for any further
advice!  (That is, if you manage to figure out how to fix your
sabotaged car and repair the cut phone lines.)

                                          Attourneys at Law
