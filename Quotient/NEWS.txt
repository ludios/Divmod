  - Initial public release.

    This system is still _HIGHLY_ experimental!  Use at your own risk.  The
    only _supported_ use for it is deployment on the Divmod service, where we
    can closely monitor, manage, and update it.

    This release is simply to get Quotient integrated into the Divmod release
    procedure and streamline the process for publishing future releases.  We do
    not promise to provide even such basic support as database upgraders for
    objects whose schema we change, yet.
