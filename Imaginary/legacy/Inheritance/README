Introduction

  This is a sample map for twisted reality.  You need the Twisted project
  (http://twistedmatrix.com) to get this to do anything useful.

  This is packaged as a Twisted plugin; just drop it in your
  ~/TwistedPlugins directory, and run twistd -g Inheritance.

About Inheritance

  Inheritance is the beginnings of a lovecraftian interactive fictional world;
  it is far from complete but you can get some definite ideas about its design
  by reading the inline documentation in the source code.

  Although the twisted.reality infrastructure is kept current as a testbed for
  other Twisted features, the Inheritance game itself has fallen into
  disrepair.  e-mail twisted-python@twistedmatrix.com if you'd like to
  contribute.
