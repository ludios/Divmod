<b><tt>Anaar</tt></b> (<i>ahn-nar</i>)
<blockquote>
The "damnable enemies" of the <a href = "#divuthan">Divuthan</a> in the <a href = "#greatwar">great war</a>, the Anaar are actually a fairly peaceful race, and were provoked into increasingly violent measures by the Divuthans' xenophobia. Divuthan records suggest that the Anaar were originally an aquatic race, but for various reasons, the physical structure and classification of the primitive Anaar are difficult to determine. In any case, comparisons indicate that the Anaar and Divuthan share a similar evolutionary background, and the near-identical composition (and adjacent orbits) of their homeworlds serve to reinforce that theory.
<p>
While the Anaar possessed fairly advanced conventional technology, and were beginning a promising space program at the time of the war, most of their achievements were based on their mastery of genetic engineering. At the peak of their civilization, the Anaar were capable of producing carbon based life forms of almost any specification imaginable, as well as inducing complex instincts and behavioral instructions in their progeny. Most of these creatures, including the modern Anaar, were capable of absorbing specially compiled samples of DNA and developing the characteristics they defined almost immediately... These samples ranged from orders and instinctual memories to mutations that would cause the growth of new organs or chemical systems in the recipients body. There are distinct limitations to this process (each sample had to be carefully configured to match the subject it was meant to be used on, and the combination of some traits apparently led to unforeseen and extremely undesirable side effects) but the Anaar had refined it to almost perfect level by the time they had encountered the Divuthan.
<p>
Over the course of the <a href = "#greatwar">Great War</a>, the Anaar developed a race of soldier organisms called <a href="#angels">Angels</a> to destroy the Divuthan, and escort a <a href="#birthpod">Birthpod</a> (A mobile genetics laboratory) to Divu to produce a deadly biological weapon. Despite the Angels' success, the Divuthan's ultimate weapon, Kenaan, proved to be more than a match for the Anaar's own defenses, and succeeded in razing their homeworld into a radioactive wasteland. 
<p>
Aside from whatever is left inside the missing Birthpod, and the remaining Angel, Huntyre, the Anaar civilization seems to have been destroyed. It is possible that they attempted to colonize other planets, but Divu was the closest, and the first target of their explorations, so it is reasonable to assume that any other colonies of Anaar civilization that still exist are very small and self sufficient.

<b><tt>Angels</tt></b> (<i>angels</i>)
<blockquote>
<p>
Both the Magnum Opus and swan song of the <a href="#anaar">Anaar</a> genetic engineering program, angels were intelligent, obedient, and capable of adapting quickly to changes in their environment and in the tactics of their enemies. The Angels also possessed a number of extremely potent psychic abilities, most of which were designed to take advantage of the <a href="#divuthan">Divuthans</a>' sensitive minds and nervous systems. While the Angels resemble Divuthan to a great degree, their internal organs are almost completely different, and they bear a set of large wings on their shoulders. These "wings" are actually the organs responsible for their psychic and telekinetic abilities, and while connected directly to the spine and central nervous system, they are a separate from the brain for purposes of redundancy.
<p>
The last model of Angel released by the Anaar <a href="#birthpod">Birthpod</a> was capable of "flying" (A telekinetic effect in which the wings are used mostly for balance and attitude control, resembling more of a gliding motion), emitting rapid pulses of psychic energy, capable of causing seizures and massive hemorrhaging in the brains of sensitive subjects, and "eating" the biochemical energy of other lifeforms, at a rate sufficient to render them to dust in a few seconds of contact. This feeding mechanism is poorly understood at best, but the Angels who possess it seem to have developed sharply pointed incisors as a side effect (or possibly as a visible marker of the alteration, a common practice among the Anaar).
<p>
A number of Angels were sent to Divu during the <a href = "#greatwar">Great War</a> to escort the Birthpod, which, in turn, produced a great number more. Both the Angels and the birthpod were apparently controlled by means of a telepathic connection, but the Anaar themselves did not possess the ability to establish it, and relied on complicated machines to amplify and transmit their instructions. The carrier signal for the connection bears a strong resemblance to music, albeit an endlessly changing, ambient tone, and also served to keep the Angels docile and well behaved between instructions. During the Angel's assault on the Divuthan city, most of the Angels were killed by the Divuthan's mechanical servants, but <a href="#huntyre">Huntyre</a>, one of the most advanced of the group, managed to survive by entering a cryogenic suspension tube.
<p>
In the wake of the battle, the other surviving angels slowly died off, either from mortal wounds or simple starvation, left completely without instructions in a maze of underground tunnels. They had thoroughly massacred and consumed their Divuthan enemies, but many of their slaves, the psychically impaired <a href="#divu'en">Divu'en</a>, were able to escape, being mostly immune to the psychic pulses and looking considerably different than the Angels' chosen targets. The Angels had won their side of the war by wiping out the hostile portion of the population of Divu, but they were unable to save their masters from the Divuthan's own doomsday weapon, the war machine <a href = "#kenaan">Kenaan</a>.

<p>
<b><tt>Great War, the </tt></b> (<i>great war</i>)
<blockquote>
The Great War refers to a conflict very early in the history of <a href = "#divu">Divu</a>, when it's ruling race, the <a href="#divuthan">Divuthan</a>, encountered the exploratory vehicles of the <a href="#anaar">Anaar</a>, the inhabitants of the adjacent planet.
<p>
After the Anaar probes which landed on Divu were "mysteriously" destroyed,a larger manned vessel was sent to investigate the planet, and it too met with a rather unpleasant fate. The Divuthan, unable to communicate mentally with the newcomers, and extremely hostile towards anything which defied the strict order of their society, saw the Anaar as serious threat and a mortal enemy even before formal contact could be established. After the Anaar placed additional probes in orbit around Divu to search for their missing craft, the Divuthan began to urge on their own space program, and "retaliated" for the visit with primitive orbital bombardment. Before long, the two races had put aside their similarities and social development, and began a devastating war. Divuthan records suggest that the Anaar themselves were originally an aquatic race, but for various reasons, the physical structure and classification of the primitive Anaar are difficult to determine. In any case, comparisons indicate that the Anaar and Divuthan share a similar evolutionary background, and the near-identical composition (and adjacent orbits) of their homeworlds serve to reinforce that theory.
<p>
Over the course of the war, the Anaar developed a series of soldier-organisms to attack the Divuthan, the cultimation of which was the Hunter series, referred to as <a href = "#angels">Angels</a> by the Divuthan. The angels were intelligent, extremely adaptable creatures, as well as having been tailored with the Divuthan's physiology in mind, and proved to be extremely effective at their task. A number of Angels were sent to Divu along with a mobile genetics node, referred to as a Birthpod, which was intended to be used to directly sample Divuthan DNA in the interests of developing diseases and biological weapons. While the Birthpod did not succeed, and its status is still unclear, it was able to produce a large number of Angels, which proved to be more than enough to destroy the Anaar's enemies... The relatively small number of Angels which were able to enter the Divuthan's underground city managed to exterminate them almost completely. While most of the Angels were killed in the process, and the remainder starved to death or died of their injuries, One of the surviving angels, later referred to as <a href = "#huntyre">Huntyre</a>, entered an automated cryogenic suspension tube shortly after the battle was over, and would remain in that state for several hundred years.
<p>
The Anaar's victory was short lived, however, as the Divuthan's ultimate weapon entered their homeworld's atmosphere during the same orbital period that the Birthpod touched down on Divu. <a href = "#kenaan">Kenaan</a>, as the Divuthan referred to it, was a war machine in the truest possible sense. Before it had finished re-entry, it had adjusted itself to vent the most harmful possible chemical byproducts into the atmosphere, and was emitting the most locally  wavelengths of radiation possible. It scythed cities into rubble with burning rays of light, tainted the oceans with poisons, and blackened the sky with dust from a thousand nuclear impacts. Even the deadliest of the Anaar's flying abominations could not survive long enough in its presence to attack it, and their conventional weapons were unable to penetrate its defenses. In a few short months, Kenaan had destroyed almost every living thing on the surface of the Anaar homeworld, and ensured that nothing would ever live there again.
<p>
The war left the two civilizations in ruins, and while the  of the Divuthan would live on to start their own peaceful society, the only remainder of the Anaar appears to be Huntyre.

<b><tt>Archetypes, the Divunalian Societal</tt></b> (<i>Ahr-keh-types</i>)
<blockquote>
The modern and most organized of the Divu'en religious movements is based around a peaceful, harmonious way of life, in which the people work together to fill prescribed but equal roles in society. Each of these roles is represented by an Archetype, with it's own function and place in both industry and society. Each is named in the old language, and the concepts they represent are difficult to express succinctly; each has a number of different qualities and attributes, which serve both to define the Archetype in more detail, and to aid young Divu'en in choosing their place.
<blockquote>
<a name="storyteller">
		The Storyteller: A central figure to the Archetypes, although his name is somewhat misleading. He is also referred to as the Prophet, the Keeper, and the Weaver, although all of his names are meant in an active sense; The Storyteller dictates the order of the world, and the tales he tells are occurring as he writes them. Still, he is seen more as a leader than as a god: the implication is that he maintains an awareness of all things, and uses that knowledge to guide the progression of the world. He is a leader and a visionary, but one who is wise above all, and grounded firmly in the reality of the world he inhabits.
<p>
<a name="historian">
		The Historian: Somewhat opposed to the Architect, the Historian records the past, and gleans wisdom from the results of what has already come to be. He views the world in terms of precedents, always weighing the evidence of history against the issues of the present. He is also somewhat of an explorer, albeit one who works backwards, searching to uncover the treasures of the past. His true prize, however, is the knowledge and wisdom gained from recovering a part of what has been lost to the ravages of time.
<p>
<a name="architect">
		The Architect: Similar in some ways to the Storyteller, the Architect is also known as the Mechanist, the Artificer, and the Innovator. He is a creative figure, much like the Storyteller, but his role is in the support of progress, new ideas, and plans for the future. He is ingenious, thorough, and comprehensive in his tasks, and always questing towards new goals and accomplishments.
<p>
<a name="dreamer">
		The Dreamer: Also referred to as The Artist and The Visionary, she represents the truly inspired. Of all the Archetypes, she is the most purely creative, lacking the authority of the Storyteller and the structure of the Architect, her work difficult to control or define. She is sensitive to the world around her, and while her mode of expression may be abstract or unusual, she captures details with a clarity few others can equal. She sees things no one else can see, and views everything through a unique perspective: her insight can be extremely enlightening if it is properly understood.
<p>
<a name="changeling">
		The Changeling: The most unique of the archetypes, the Changeling is everyone and no one. It serves many purposes, but holds none above the others; It is a jack of all trades, and master of none. It is the friend who knows everyone, and the enemy of whom no one is aware. It is unpredictable and confusing, and hides its secrets in plain sight. It is adaptable to any situation, but becomes restless if it is forced to stay in one role for too long. In a sense, it is change, personified, but it is just as much the ability to become indistinguishable from those around it.
<p>
<a name="judge">
		The Judge: Magistrate, Curmudgeon, and Cynic, the Judge exists in a perfectly rational world of his own, and nothing escapes his careful analysis. He is thorough, logical, and impartial in his decisions, and makes it his quest to impart some of that logic into the world around him. While his bearing may seem close-minded and uncreative at times, his scrutiny is unfailing, and the world that he builds around himself is based in unquestionable conclusions.
<p>
<a name="bureauocrat">
		  The Bureaucrat, or lawmaker, as he is sometimes called, is an organizer... He seeks to classify all things into their component parts, and to bind them into the correct state of being with rules and laws. He is a servant of order, and seeks to maintain normality in the world around him. While his ideals are pure, his actions are sometimes polluted by his tendancy to uphold the laws themselves rather than their intentions.
<p>
<a name="priest">
		  The Priest: The cleric, the hierophant, and the minister, the Priest seeks to maintain a spiritual harmony in the world. He is a humanitarian, a teacher, and a arbitrator, serving both to maintain the morals and traditions of his culture, and to provide spiritual guidance and comfort to the less enlightened. Similarly to the bureaucrat, his influence guides the morals and beliefs of those around him, and he must walk a fine line between upholding the traditions he has been taught, and making his own rational descisions, both for himself and for his believers.
<a name="intrigue">
		  The Intrigue: She is known by a number of names, The mystery, the gossip, the wanderer, the unseen... Like the changeling, she is difficult to define or constrain. She listens at every door, and overhears every conversation, seemingly everywhere, but never where she could be noticed. She is elusive, crafty, and calculating, but seems unremarkably normal when observed. She appears to be passive, but only because her actions are invisible. She appears to be silent, but only because she is listening. Her knowledge and power are substantial and unmeasurable, reaching through lines of influence that conceal them from view.

<blockquote>

Physically, Maxwell is a short, grey haired, grey eyed man who has a
penchant for wearing grey.  The reasons for this are revealed in <a
href="#apocalypse">John's Apocalypse</a>

Maxwell Greysen was, on earth, a popular science fiction writer.  This
was not something he ever wanted to be -- he had always hoped to be a
<i>good</i> science fiction writer, and that is an entirely different
animal.  Maxwell's popularity was due primarily to two factors.

Firstly, he has been writing a science-fiction series for several years,
known as the "DeathBlaster trilogy".  Although it is currently in its
ninth book, the publishers like the sound of the word "trilogy" so they
keep calling it that.  Ever since "DeathBlaster III: Galactor of the Moon
People", it's been downhill for Max.

Second, his publishers always enclosed a color photograph of him at the
back of every book. He looked more like a rock star than a novelist --
very dark black hair, boyish features, bright green eyes... Also, the
particular picture they used was taken before the publishing industry
completely sucked the life and energy out of him.

If Maxwell's fans had seen him in the days before he was transported to
Divunal, they wouldn't have been nearly so eager to idolize him.  His hair
was greasy and unkempt, his green eyes were perpetually bloodshot from
stress and alcohol, which did little to keep his features looking
"boyish".

Drunk and looking for inspiration in Sam's Used Book Emporium, Maxwell
passed out in an obscure corner of the bookstore.  He awoke later
disoriented, and unable to find his way out.

Tsiale, the guardian spirit of the library in Divunal, introduced herself
to Maxwell and showed him the nature of his new powers.  He learned them
painstakingly over a period of months, and after having mastered them
completely, he built himself a palace in a painting off of the art room.

In Divunal, Maxwell has a relationship with the written word which is
somewhat like the Force -- sometimes he can use it to change things,
sometimes he has to obey its commands.  Divunal is the way it is in
part because Maxwell has been writing stories about it -- Maxwell is
the way he is in part because he is a character in that story.

<blockquote>
Twin (real name lost to the past due to CIA confidentiality) was an 
officer in the American navy. He was participating in a research program 
to further espionage by giving him biochemical shapeshifting abilities. 
He loved cloak-and-dagger stuff, he loved the excitement, and he always 
felt it was helping fewer people get killed. One day he discovered 
something wasn't right with the research facility he was being 
"conditioned" in. When he discovered the CIA was planning to turn him 
into a weapon rather than an information-gatherer, he tried to escape - 
pursued by agents from the CIA. The CIA caught him and locked him up. 
Faking entrapment, which he was able to leave at any point due to his new 
abilities, he began to perform a series of pranks meant to bring disorder 
to the project from the inside out. Meanwhile, the CIA gave him a series 
of drugs to try to terminate his shapeshifting but the drugs merely 
brought on a kind of schizophrenia - causing Twin to see the CIA in any 
opposition. The research facility was a lab dense in information. Over 
time, Twin eventually noticed the test-tubes around him turning into 
books. No longer controled by the drugs, Twin escaped the CIA. He got to 
Divunal and was put into the "changeling" archetype... but the skystone 
had an interesting reaction with his blood after the experiments that 
were performed on him and his abilities became profoundly enhanced to the 
point where he was able to change shape very often and without any 
effort. Agent Moore, an agent on Twin's tail, entered Divunal with the 
intention of getting the job done. However the previous humans screwed 
him up something fierce- into a parody of what he was before yet 
possessing the same determination and businesslike brilliance. Twin's true 
form was left in its past and what's left was an ever-changing 
mischievous entity who, by spread of legend, was granted the name "Twin" 
because of its shapechanging abilities.
