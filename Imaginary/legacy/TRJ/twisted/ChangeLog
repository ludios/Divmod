2000-01-08  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/author/It.java:
	* twisted/reality/author/She.java:
	* twisted/reality/author/He.java:	
	* twisted/reality/author/HeSheIt.java: Deleted the three
	individual verbs, and replaced them with a single, more efficient
	multialiased verb that has the same snazzily described
	effect. Thank you, thank you. Your tax dollars at work.
	
	* StringSet.java: Rewrote so that the descriptive text was much
	more appropriate for the many possible uses of this verb.

2000-1-02 James Knight <james@twistedmatrix.com>

	* TextAreaTreeCellRenderer.java: * WrappableJTree.java: Added to
	work around huge annoyances in the way swing is designed in order
	to have Trees that can have text that wraps in them.
	
	* FTheme.java: * GameWindow.java: * SwingNozzle.java: Initial
	changes to make the item list a JTree, despite swing's best
	efforts to prevent me. This code has quite a few (known) bugs at
	the moment.

1999-12-30  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/author/ThingSet.java: Fixed the messed up pronoun.
	
1999-12-30  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* JAnswerDialog.java: It's more likely that you'll be able to see
	long chunks of text now ...

1999-12-29  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* NetClientUser.java: 
	* Player.java: 
	* Thing.java: "Under the Water (in the submarine):Maxwell"

1999-12-28  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Enable.java: errmmm.... 'disable' should probably do something
	different than 'enable' =) stupid typo fixed.

1999-12-28  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/author/Theme.java: Fixed the pronoun issue in
	the descriptive text.

1999-12-28  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Drop.java: Bug ID 4 fixed.

	* ResponseWindow.java: OK and cancel buttons.  Bug ID 1 fixed.

	* TRUtils.java: New utilities class for static utilities (such as
	the ambiguity thing it contains now)

	* Name.java: Fixes for Dave's patch to hisher() so that verbs
	written with old name.to posessive conventions will continue to
	function.
	
	* Location.java: removed (HOPEFULLY) the last vestiges of the
	kludgage related to the client not being able to parse item lists
	correctly.  Bug ID 3 fixed.

	* Age.java: added 'shutdown' event that gets handled when the
	server shuts down. This is mainly for cyclic events (cough,
	cockroach, cough) but is probably a good idea in general.

1999-12-28  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/plugin/Read.java: Added a generic Read verb for
	simple readable objects. Basically a fancier general purpose open
	source replacement for the old Divunal TrivialRead.

1999-12-27  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/Thing.java: Took out outdated, extranneous, and
	pissing-me-off spaces from Thing.himher() and Thing.HimHer()

	* twisted/reality/plugin/furniture/Stand.java: 
	* twisted/reality/plugin/furniture/Sit.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/furniture/Lie.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/door/OpenCloseSwingingDoor.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/door/Open.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/door/Close.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/clothes/WearRemove.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/clothes/ClothingPut.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Winded.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Socials.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Say.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/ReadLook.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Quit.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/PlayerSayHandler.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/OpenCloseContainer.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Look.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Inventory.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Go.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Give.java:
	* twisted/reality/plugin/Emote.java: Added helpful comments in
	JavaDoc format, so that all of our freely available TR verbs might
	make some sense to people, both in the code and in the TR Package
	Index.
	
	* reality/author/She.java:
	* reality/author/It.java:
	* reality/author/He.java: Now uses the newly available Pronoun.pos()
	correctly.

1999-12-24  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Makefile.dist: Distribution has been munged yet again, to
	provide a basic "editor" character in every map, so we don't have
	to manually hand-hack it in with every release.

	* NetClientUser.java: Heirarchies are working right again, and
	more kludgage from Location was removed.

	* Persist.java: Map fragments are now output in a sorted order
	according to their name.

	* Sort.java: Thanks to Phil for providing me the method to base
	this off of.  Currently this implements only Quicksort, and only
	an alphabetical comparison.  If anybody wants to stick a
	bubble-sort in feel free =)

	* Location.java: Removed multi-line 'isHereTo' cruft and
	associated updating nonsense in preparation for James's new
	JListified faucet ... also added a dispoe() method to scatter the
	contents of a location before deleting it.  Thi is subject to
	change though, since I'm not sure what the 'correct' behaviour
	is... comments?

	* Player.java: Fixed the who-is-logged-in bug and the horribly
	ambiguous documentation in transferControlTo

	* Take.java: Speaking of which, you shouldn't be able to take
	something out of something another player is holding / wearing.
	Now you can't.

	* Put.java: You really shouldn't be able to put things inside
	themselves.  Now you can't.

1999-12-23  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Pronoun.java: Capitalization fixes as well as the addition of
	Pronoun.pos ... no more Name.of(a,b) hackarounds.

	* Thing.java: Another one-line fix; this one was causing KillProp
	with certain kinds of dynamic properties to go into an infinite
	loop.

1999-12-23  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/author/She.java: 
	* twisted/reality/author/He.java: Now has a defaultPrep "with",
	like all good reality implement-based authoring verbs. Now has
	GenderChanger-esque descriptive text, and handles self use
	correctly.

	* twisted/reality/author/It.java: Added the long missing verb for
	setting gender to neutral (neutral counterpart to He and
	She). Also has GenderChanger-esque descriptive text, and handles
	self use correctly.

	* twisted/reality/plugin/clothes/ClothingPut.java: Added a Put
	verb for clothing containers... You must be wearing them to put
	things in them. It's actually Ying's change, and she/we will
	probably make it more flexible in the future.

---------- Twisted Reality 1.2.1 Released ----------

1999-12-22  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Look.java: Fixed 'look in' so it wouldn't do that weird
	item-listing thing that Ben put in all these aeons ago.

	* Inventory.java: Component objects (except your clothes) should
	not be displayed when you're taking an inventory.  Now they're
	not.

1999-12-22  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Take.java: Now says "You can't take that" instead of "Nice Try!" which was perhaps a little too sarcastic, and unclear.

	* Put.java: Now checks for Operable on the container before
	letting you put stuff into it.  ;-)

	* Player.java: ResponseProcessors no longer blow up if you click
	Okay (e.g. close the window) on a Response thinger whose Processor
	is null.

1999-12-22  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* SwingNozzle.java: Focus handling goes back to the "wrong" way
	which seems (?) to work better.

	* Enable.java: Handles exceptions more gracefully now.

	* VectorList.java: Made it really be a persistable.  Oops.

	* Player.java: Fixed ability stuff to be the same as verb stuff
	re; ClassCastException, also fixed hears() so it doesn't log you
	out if it sends null :-\

	* Thing.java: changed internalEnable and internalDisable to throw
	exceptions if a verb alias is already in use.
	
	* Sentence.java: fixed hasDirect FOR THE FINAL TIME

	* ThingFactory.java: 
	* PlayerFactory.java: More gracefully handled various exceptions
	that can occurr during ability / verb operations when loading the
	map!

	* Location.java: Made TellEverybody return the correct
	Enumeration!
	

1999-12-22  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/author/Enable.java: Now uses
	IllegalArgumentException to tell the poor Author involved that his
	attempt has failed, instead of cheerfully announcing that
	everything's cool.

	* twisted/reality/author/Allow.java: Now uses
	IllegalArgumentException to tell the poor Author involved that his
	attempt has failed, instead of cheerfully announcing that
	everything's cool.

	* twisted/reality/author/KillProp.java: Now actually tells you if
	the property you're trying to kill doesn't exist instead of
	cheerfully announcing a sucessful deletion.

1999-12-20  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Player.java: Fixed the outdated and misleading quote about
	Players not being able to go into Locations.

1999-12-20  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Sentence.java: fixed that niggling bug with hasDirect (really)

	* ThingPropSetup.java: 
	* SuperSetup.java: 
	* PortalSetup.java: 
	* PlacementSetup.java: Added some error-checking code which will
	let us know if pieces are missing from a map.

	* Persist.java: added something for partial map-persistance so we
	can start putting together an Inheritance map.

	* LoginDialog.java: 
	* GameWindow.java: Finally fixed the LAST vestiges of the haunting
	focus problems which plague us!
	
1999-12-19  James Knight <james@twistedmatrix.com>
	* Faucet: Made command [meta] cxva work for better MacOS usage.
	  Readded handleQuit().
	  Made focus stick much better on the input field.
	  Made cut and paste work right on disabled TextThingys (swing sucks).
	  Changed the Nozzle interface to have the right interface for item adding/removal.

1999-12-19  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Age.java: Incremented the version number for the release...

1999-12-17  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* SwingNozzle.java: setText, which is allegedly thread-safe, is
	now getting called from the IO dispatching thread rather than
	Swing's thread.  This doesn't make any difference to me, but it
	was bothering james and it appears to work fine this way :-)

	* NetClientUser.java: User won't see toplevel hierarchy of rooms
	when looking at stuff anymore.  (oops)

1999-12-13  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Faucet: Reimplemented damn near everything.  Things should work
	a LOT nicer now.  *wukka wukka wukka* ...  The most impressive
	part of this is Nozzle.java, since we're going to want to make
	Nozzles in different bindings (like Biscotti or J-SDL (if it ever
	gets written) or whatever)

1999-12-11  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/Sentence.java: Fixed hasDirect(), which was
	ALWAYS RETURNING TRUE. GRRR... I really thought this wasn't
	working, but it always seemed like it was me being a bad
	programmer before.

	* twisted/reality/Thing.java: Added JavaDoc docs and comments to
	Thing.place()

1999-12-11  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/Location.java: 
	* twisted/reality/Thing.java: a lot of changes to the way movement
	works.  Mostly bugfixes, but this cleans out the code a lot...
	
	* twisted/reality/Player.java: a small bugfix that allows players
	to specify the object they're currently looking at
	case-insensitively.

	* twisted/reality/author/ClusterBomb.java: a verb with a utility
	method to allow people to list rooms that are connected to the
	current room.

1999-12-11  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/author/StringPropProcessor.java: Now uses the
	new, correctly intercapped topPlace() method that we just made.

	* twisted/reality/Thing.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() method that we just made.

	* twisted/reality/Sentence.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() method that we just made.

	* twisted/reality/Player.java: Now uses the new, correctly
	intercapped topPlace() method that we just made.

1999-12-10  Mr. Tenth  <tenth@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality/author/MoodSet.java: Now has an "unmood" version
	which sets mood to null, which there was previously no easy way to
	do.

1999-11-30  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* reality/author/CVS.java: directories now update as well.

	* reality/Thing.java: fixed a stupid bug.  Also, things now refer
	to themseles as "You".  (Let's see how many weird bugs THAT
	introduces!)

	* reality/plugin/Take.java: added more politically correct
	"pretzel thing"

1999-11-07  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added ChangeLog so future changes will be logged.
