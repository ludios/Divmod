FIXED <1> Java Faucet: ResponseProcessor windows have no Save or Close
buttons. This is especially bad because if you hit the close window
button (your only option) it always chooses Save, which is often not
want you want to do anyway, and very bad for verbs like "CVS" and, due
to another bug, "Listen". We might actually want to have configurable
messages, or even just a response window type thing with not buttons
that Cancels when you close it (for scrutinize, etc.)

FIXED <2> TR: ResponseProcessor Windows cause a null pointer exception if
the Processor is set to null and you hit the Save button... This
shouldn't happen, since ResponseProcessor may just be trying to get
your attention (a la "Listen")

FIXED <3> If you place an object into a Broadcast container, and make the
object a component, it will still be broadcast visibly in the contents
view of the container, until you refresh the view. For example, if you
look at tenth, and he is holding the clip and the gun, and puts the
clip into the gun, the clip will appear as a broadcast object inside
the gun... If you look away and look back, the clip will be concealed
from view again. I believe this may actually be a problem with the
load/unload clip verb (the order it moves the object and makes it a
component), much like the problem with Put not checking
operability... I'll revise this bug after more research.

FIXED <4> Drop needs to be intelligent like Take, and filter the
ambiguity for stuff you're holding.

FIXED <5> Take shouldn't be allowed to take things from locations that
players are wearing.

WORKAROUND <6> It's impossible to disable/renable/refrump a verb whose
aliases have changed.

Workaround: diable/refrump/enable, and this problem won't occurr.
This will be addressed in a future version of the Reality Pump
(hopefully rather soon)...
